## 1999-project



1999.io needs a place for docs, support, sample code, and a place to store the default templates. This is that place.



#### Updates

##### v0.40 - 4/2/16 by DW

Started the project off with the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/1999-project/tree/master/defaults">defaults</a>. 

Included are the default menubar and template in OPML and the menubar in HTML.

These will stay updated along with any changes I make to the ones actually used by the 1999.io app.

They're provided as a reference and a way to track changes to the templates.
