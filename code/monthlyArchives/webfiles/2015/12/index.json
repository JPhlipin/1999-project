But the fact that it works and isn't all that bad for a developer to setup means it could be automated/simplified/expanded on. I mean how are we going to get regular users in the habit of using source control? Or email encryption? Or eat vegetables instead of junk food? There comes a time when they're going to have to step up a bit, maybe less in the future but they've got to give a damn. I put my chicken scratch notes on a couple of ways you can setup pages like this in Github when I created two sites. The latter uses a custom domain and yes you can have different domains per repo or subdomains per branch, that type of thing - I've got links to different resources in my notes. The former uses a https://blabllaba.github.io domain. Here's the link to my notes&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1iSTHNIS2FxeUFLd2lJalNSS2c/view?usp=sharing</p>",

It's also more efficient at routing information and ideas from sources of news to users of news. This is what I called <i>Sources Go Direct.</i></p><p>I first really felt that when I was running an anchor desk from my house in California on 9/11. I had a great connection with lots of people who were in harm's way in NYC. I was able to make a contribution to the flow of news by simply routing it from the people who had it to the people who wanted it.</p><p>It wasn't hard. It was access journalism. I had access to the sources, and I just moved what they were reporting out onto the wire.</p><p>In reality that's all journalism ever was. Taking information from sources and publishing it. The Internet makes easier and less expensive. It takes all the glory out of it, which is a good thing imho.</p><p>As a software developer, through my work in blogging, podcasting and RSS, I have been able to make the tools better at supporting this model. And there's a way for the existing news industry to participate, but they are <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/07/28/dentonVsSourcesGoDirect.html\">clinging</a> to the outdated model, the idea that their front page is a thing. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/11/19/0316.html\">Point offsite</a> from a <a href=\"http://radio3.io/rivers/\">river</a> of the news sources you follow. That's how you create the next wave of news systems. The tech industry is going this way, quickly now. But it's still not too late.&nbsp;</p>",

They had a mobile app already, it was a huge thing, required lots of navigation to find one story! I had a way to scroll through all the stories.

The other day I read a piece written by Marc Canter about how Adobe didn't feel they had enough time to port Director to the web, so they went with Flash instead. As a result, all the work that had been put into Director way beyond what Flash could do, was lost. I look at the same thing in the Frontier codebase. It's so far ahead of the runtime environment of the web, but that doesn't matter, because the web went a different way. Now I develop in a much more fragile environment and it goes much slower and we don't get as far. And in the end very few people use the result anyway. You saw that with <a href=\"http://fargo.io/\">Fargo</a>\n, right? It's great, unique software. It could really help Dropbox or any of their competitors. But they wouldn't even meet with me to look at it! It's the way the world works. Progress comes slowly. &nbsp;</p>",

As you say, have a way for readers to know that there is something new in the longform piece.

Which of your teeth should you floss? Only the ones you want to keep. (He answered his own question, witty fellow.)</span></p><p>So the answer for the platform vendor is really simple.</p><p>If you want to deprecate an API, maybe you shouldn't be in the API business at all? Because when you deprecate, the developers will wonder, next time, when you will pull the rug out from under their work.&nbsp;</p><p>They will have to guess how much use the API will get. And how much is enough for you? How can they possibly gauge that? Maybe next year someone else will be in charge. Maybe they won't like or understand the API. Maybe they don't really tell us the reason they're deprecating. Maybe use has nothing to do with it? Maybe they have a chance for some cred within your organization, and having their name on some \"new\" technology is a way to do that?</p><p>It's a funny game. Really imho the only APIs you can trust are ones that no one owns, where there isn't a single vendor implementing it. That was one of the reasons why I froze <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS</a>\n in 2002. I wanted to build on it, and didn't want to go back and have to continually re-implement the same functionality because some company or working group at the W3C wanted to rip up the pavement.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Under an earlier <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/04/0566.html\">post</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/basus\">Shrutarshi Basu</a> asks:</p><blockquote>Without being able to deprecate APIs, how do we go about fixing or evolving API specifications? What's a good way for API providers to learn from how developers are actually using (or not using their APIs) and make appropriate changes over time?</blockquote><p>The answer is simply \"no\" you can't do it, there's no way. That's why you should be careful when designing a new format or protocol, because once you deploy, that's it, it's done, move on to something else.</p><p>Now that doesn't mean there won't be a competing format or protocol in the future. But I don't generally think this is a good idea. I have a motto \"Two ways to do something is worse than one, no matter how much better the second way is.\" The reason is simple, you'll have to support the old way even if you've come up with a better way to do it. So you might as well just live with the original way. It's simpler for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Look at an example in the real world. In NYC we have a famous street called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(Manhattan)\">Broadway</a> that runs approximately north-south most of the length of Manhattan, from the southern tip of the island to the Bronx and Westchester County. It's a very strange street in a city that's a grid of east-west streets and north-south avenues that all meet at right angles because Broadway runs on a diagonal. Everywhere it intersects with an avenue is a \"square\" (which aren't actually square, btw) and a huge traffic mess. It's mostly avenue but it has a bit of street in it too.&nbsp;</p><p>Broadway is weird but it's here to stay. It's an API to the buildings that were built along the street and to the subway lines and the complex of power, water and sewage lines that run underneath it, and more recently phone and computer networks. To deprecate Broadway would cause huge disruption in the city that grew up around it. Even so I imagine at some point early in the history of the city people debated whether such an odd road made sense, and argued that it should be replaced with an API that was more \"modern.\" But it never happened. To this day Broadway, one of the world's most famous streets, thrives and bustles. Skyscrapers rise alongside it at the bottom of the island. Times Square is where the famous New Year's celebration takes place. All the way up to the northern edge of the city and beyond, the oddball road that's neither a street or an avenue occupies a place in the minds of developers and users, and it ain't going nowhere.&nbsp;</p><p>If your format or protocol takes off, you're stuck with it, but that's a good thing! Now we have a way to interop. All software is shitty and that includes formats and protocols. Embrace its weirdness. Because the weirder it is the more likely it is that it's doing its job.</p><p>BTW, while Broadway itself stays where it is, the things built around it change all the time! It was originally the <a href=\"http://www.anthropologyinpractice.com/2009/11/back-in-time-walking-wickquasgeck-trail.html\">Wickquasgeck Trail</a>, used by Native Americans, it wandered through woods and swamps. The road developed when the Dutch first settled Manhattan, when it was called New Amsterdam. Back then it was a dirt road that started in 17th century village. Today there are amazing structures built along Broadway, even in my lifetime the world of Broadway has been transformed several times.&nbsp;</p><p>New York is a city of constant change. But it accomplishes that by holding some things constant. It's a good model for platform evolution.&nbsp;</p>",

I can see that in my Facebook and Twitter feeds. But I don't think it compares with the previous two episodes. It was more of a laundry list of things they felt the need to resolve before moving on to the next season or wherever they're going when the whole thing's done.&nbsp;</p><p>The art of serial TV shows these days is in the plot twists and cliffhangers. And a great serial show, like Leftovers, must end its run with the best cliffhanger. The one that leaves you wanting for more, knowing it's never going to come. That's the kind of torture I want these show runners to indulge in.&nbsp;</p><p>But Leftovers tied off all the loose-ends, with mostly happy endings.&nbsp;</p><p>Megan has something evil planned, but it turns out to be Meh!</p><p>The girls come back, but what was the big thing they did? Meh!</p><p>Yes the cop (who reminds me of Jack Dorsey) goes on yet another adventure in the afterlife, and like us he's pissed about it, but there's no time to do anything there, so he sings <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9wd9bS1FM\">Homeward Bound</a>, clicks his heels three times and he's back in Kansas (I mean Texas).</p><p>The braindead wife comes back to life, and remembers having sex with the husband, so we know he's off the hook. More predictable Meh!</p><p>The baby gets stolen, but in a few seconds she's back with her mom.</p><p>And the whole season ends with the cop in the loving arms of his mostly female posse. It's all good! But that's not a proper ending for an apocalyptic show. I think they sold out. They could have left us with something empty and depraved to ponder before saying goodbye.</p><p><span>It was most definitely a mediocre season-ender. Think of some of the great ones. The Sopranos, which drops you off on the cliff of Existence and doesn't offer an opinion about what happens next. Or Six Feet Under that kills off all the characters in a series of vignettes in the last ten minutes of the last episode, each sadder and more meaningless than the previous, except of course for lovely Claire. These were magnificent endings. Even Lost left us in a lurch, saying basically fuck you we have no idea what all this means. At least this show didn't try to explain The Departure, although we're left wondering if possibly it </span><i>might</i><span> all be a prank of teenage girls.&nbsp;</span></p>",

Huge.&nbsp;</p><p>Back to Dropbox.</p><p>Their apps didn't work in the market, not sure why, maybe because they weren't designed to prime the pump for developers like MacWrite and MacPaint were in the early days of the Mac. Maybe Dropbox missed the target by a few degrees, maybe they had the right idea but the wrong implementation?</p><p>It might be worth a rethink. Instead of being an application -- perhaps Dropbox is an operating system? That's the way I think of it. The earliest OSes were all about managing storage, then they started doing process management, and eventually took on the user interface. But first there was storage. And of course that's exactly what Dropbox does so well.&nbsp;</p><p>If they decided to really seriously invest in an app ecosystem, they could do what any platform vendor could but never does -- invest in developers, and commit to staying out of their way. I felt Microsoft should have done this at the dawn of the web, and Google should have later, when social networks were taking off. It's too much to expect that your up-and-running tech company could act like the seat-of-the-pants art-driven app developers you need to boot up an ecosystem. I would not have made the bet they did, absorbing products, rather I would have spread investment around and let a thousand flowers bloom.&nbsp;</p><p>Focus on this. With the right set of services, mostly just interfaces for services Dropbox already provides, full apps could be developed, great apps, that <i>don't have a server component. </i>It's a huge opportunity. No one, not Twitter, not Facebook, Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Apple, Amazon, no one has done this work yet. Amazes me that such huge tasty sweet ripe fruit is hanging out there for the picking.&nbsp;</p><p>There are still lots of ways to slice this. I hope Dropbox hasn't given up on the idea of being a platform. It would be a shame, a huge missed opportunity, imho.</p>",

        "text": "<p>The other day a retired general on Fox called the President a pussy. They said he was wrong to say that, and suspended him for two weeks. But he had a point. Not just about the President, but almost everyone who has a public voice.&nbsp;</p><p>How did it come to this? I believe and in some cases know that a lot of them inside aren't pussies. But the ability to hide that has become an important qualification for being a public figure. God forbid you ever are caught saying something with any substance. Better to keep it vague. People can feel your tension when you talk. Some are better at doing this than others. Remember the guy who ran for VP with John Kerry. He was very good at lying. Turns out he was hiding a lot of hell-raising bullshit. What was his name! It escapes me.</p><p>The whole no-pussies thing has gone to incredible extremes. Now you have people saying meaningless things meant to sound as if they weren't pussified, but of course because they aren't saying anything, you can debate all you want and never prove anything.&nbsp;</p><p>25 years ago <a href=\"http://www.zangogroup.com/d/Upside/Upside_TOC_1999Dec.htm\">Upside</a> ran a cover story that asked <i>Has Silicon Valley Gone Pussy? </i>Denise Caruso <a href=\"http://www.caruso.com/work/index-sf-examiner/sf-examiner-1990/treating-the-symptom-not-the-cause/\">wrote</a> about it, though the story itself doesn't appear to be on the web. Now they make chat apps. And reinvent shit that worked 30 years ago and this passes as innovation? I guess all the newbies who have come online recently don't know that they're being sold the same old stuff. But the supply of newbies is running out. At some point the valley will have to have some new ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>(Upside <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Upside-magazine-to-cease-publication-Red-2764085.php\">ceased</a> publication in 2002.)</p><p>So. Donald Trump. A guy who talks like the other people on your living room couch as you're watching the news. He really does. That's his appeal. He gives voice to the things they'd like to say back to the TV, and do -- except no one is listening.</p><p>I don't watch TV news anymore. Haven't since Obama was elected. At first I thought we'll never get anyone better than him, so no point watching what happens. It can't get better. And it probably is getting worse. So I tuned out through threatened government shutdowns and debt defaults.&nbsp;</p><p>But the last week I've been watching MSNBC, CNN and Fox. Yes I do watch Fox, just to see what they do with the same ideas and facts that the rest of the Internet gets.&nbsp;</p><p>Interesting that Fox focuses on the \"radicalized\" terrorists. They don't seem to be paying a lot of attention to Trump. But on MSNBC and CNN, it's all-Trump-all-the-time. With little bits of Bernie Sanders thrown in. You can tell that he wishes they'd stop talking about Trump. But it's addicting. Because he's good at TV. Really is. When he says \"We just need to figure out what <i>the hell</i> is going on!\" he speaks to and for a lot of people. Stop the world, they say, I don't understand. Wait till I catch up!!</p><p>But most of all Trump doesn't appear to be a pussy. Too bad we chased away all the people who could speak from the heart, someone could stand up to him. But we decided a long time ago what we want is the pussies. So that's what we get. Trump and a stage full of pussies.&nbsp;</p><p>Interesting that Trump is just shoveling the same old shit, only people don't remember we've been here before. It's how great wars start. First the wonderful feeling that you've found other people who share your frustration. How long before there are <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/category/topics/ut-tower-shooting/\">shooters</a> wandering around <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/1-15-million-americans-have-been-killed-by-guns-since-john-lennons-death-20151208\">killing</a> the <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_29223430/da-file-formal-charges-against-accused-planned-parenthood\">people</a> Trump tells them to kill? I don't think there's much chance it stops here. Many people will faint in outrage, but he'll keep going. And if he were to stop for some reason, now that the genie is out of the bottle, there are plenty who are waiting to take his place.</p>",

It's why we gravitate toward default places to post. It's why at least in my world we all post our public code to GitHub.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course this sucks. Because GitHub is a company and they may decide someday to only host projects that support a particular political belief. They may find a way of saying it that makes me sound like a bad guy if I won't support their cause. Then I will be torn. Remove my work, or go ahead and accept their requirement. It will be a tough choice when that day comes.</p><p>Because we've lived with this approach for the whole life of the Internet, there's always been this problem with posting in multiple places, there are all kinds of systems we can't build. Pipes that go from my hub for all things related to biking to someone else's hub for all things related to <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=meatball+hero&amp;find_loc=New+York%2C+NY\">meatball heroes</a>. How do we know there are no connections here? There might be. But these places don't exist. Can't exist. Because we split the world up in a different way. The person isn't important, isn't the central organizing structure. Facebook is.&nbsp;</p><p>I said before the only places that pull me are Facebook, Twitter, etc. Not true. For food deliveries there's Seamless and Delivery.com. For car rides it's Lyft and Uber. For travel there's Kayak and Expedia.</p><p>Maybe Amazon has the right idea. They sell everything. If something new comes along eventually they will sell it. But they kicked Wikileaks off AWS when the government yelled at them. They like to sell web services to the CIA so there goes Wikileaks. That's the GitHub problem. I looked the other way when it happened on AWS. But it makes me worry about leaning too hard on Amazon.</p><p>If we could get neutral places on the Internet, with no business models attached to them and no ownership we could create some important new stuff. What? We won't know until we have it.</p>",

You don't have to please Zuck or Dorsey or Tim Cook or anyone else.</span></li><li><span>No algorithms. No control. How did that happen?</span></li><li>They don't even seem to know or care that it <i>did</i> happen.</li><li><span>This is what you all should be teaching, that there are ways to do journalism that don't have to be controlled by the tech industry. That is not part of the story you tell, but imho it is the most important part.</span></li><li>The upshot of the lack of control: There are lots of discovery apps coming online for podcasting. If it were controlled like content that flows through Facebook or Twitter, there would be room for only one discovery algorithm. I offer my own <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/\">podcatch.com</a> as an example.&nbsp;</li><li>For the future -- freedom of the press. Ultimately Facebook and Twitter are going to exert more control over what flows over their wires. We need new mechanisms that circumvent that control. Podcasting is ready-made for this. But we have to study and appreciate this, not bury it.</li></ol><p></p><p>PS: Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html\">20-minute podcast</a> I did in Sept on the origins of podcasting.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text": "<p>If you want to get an idea of how JavaScript came to be, listen to this great <a href=\"http://audio.javascriptair.com/e/00-jsair-the-past-present-and-future-of-javascript/\">interview</a> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich\">Brendan Eich</a>, the guy who created it. It's fascinating. I learned that we came close to crossing paths in Palo Alto in the 80s, several times. And this hour-long podcast just scratched the surface. There's obviously a lot more to the story than can be covered in an hour interview.</p><p>I also spent two days with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham\">Ward Cunningham</a>, the inventor of the Wiki, last summer, in Portland. The way he bootstrapped the wiki is very much the same way we <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html\">bootstrapped</a> blogging, at the same time. Why did we wait until 2015 to spend time together? We could have been helping each other all along.</p><p><span>This makes me think, how can we do better?&nbsp;</span></p><p>Here we are, the generation that brought networking to the world, but we're so bad at networking on a human scale. Like the shoes of the <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/159004/the-cobblers-children-have-no-shoes\">cobbler's kids</a>. We were so busy creating networks, we forgot to create one for ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem may be with the gatekeepers. Or the art is still too young to have the institutions that are needed to connect people. One thing was really impressive was how much the younger people who were interviewing Eich were soaking it up. And why not! Technology comes in layers. We're still using the layers that were created in the 70s, 80s and 90s, even though it's buried under the interfaces of the 00s and 10s. And the human embodiment of those layers, people like Cunningham and Eich, are still alive and kicking <i>and creating new stuff.</i></p><p>Neither of them are famous for making billions, so the press doesn't pay much attention. But great art and money don't always mix. JavaScript, no matter what you think about it, is hugely influential, as are wikis. And the ideas that went into their creation are universal. Creative developers will be learning from their work for generations to come.</p><p>I think perhaps we need to start with something like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_Actors_Studio\">Inside the Actors Studio</a>. One-on-one interviews with the key creative people who built today's networking world. And while we're at it, let's have some Actors Studios too!&nbsp;</p>",

So much so that when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Goodman\">Danny Goodman</a>, author of programming books, first saw JavaScript , he asked me if I had worked with them.</p><p>Brendan also talks about the what-if's, what if the timing had been different. Or what if he and I knew each other back then. I wonder what if some of the ideas that were baked into Frontier, at the deepest level, had made it into the browser.</p><p>For example, persistent memory. The browser has very little of it, through cookies, and then later through localStorage. But the PCs of the day could do a lot more than cookies. I know because in Frontier, first released in 1992, we made all globals persist between invocations of the the environment. So you didn't need to worry about loading and saving files to and from disk. If you created a global, it was there forever, until you deleted it. We did this with an object database, that was the second component of the environment that I implemented. The first, of course, was the outliner, which was used for editing everything from code to menubars and to browse and edit the object database.</p><p>This led to some interesting places, and made bigger projects more easily approached by small teams or individuals. Ones that would have been too complex otherwise. I can really feel that now that I am working in JavaScript, 20-plus years later, and my environment doesn't have persistent globals.&nbsp;</p><p>How close did we get? Well, a good-size piece of Frontier was integrated in Netscape, thanks to Aleks Totic, an important feature we called <a href=\"http://scripting.com/frontier/sdk/menuSharing.html\">menu sharing</a>, which allowed one app to insert a menu into another. We used this feature to add script-written commands to Netscape's menus. This made content management much more facile, a precursor to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html\">Edit This Page</a> button, in 1999, that was the basic feature of blogging software.&nbsp;</p>",

They hope it will happen in 2016, but it won't happen then either, because the web is too big and HTTPS is fraught with difficulty.</p><p>As an experiment I looked at all that I would have to do to support it on just one of my sites, and found the cost to be much higher than any potential benefit.</p><p>Let's say I wanted to do it for my main site, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">scripting.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>First I'd have to move it off <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3</a>. But I <i>like</i> having it there. It took a lot of iteration to get it there in the first place. It's a huge site for a blog. It's been around since 1994 -- over 20 years. A few years ago I put all that static content in a bucket on S3 and forgot about it. It's just there. Served very cheaply. And I don't have to worry about scale. My <a href=\"http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">RSS feed</a> is there. God knows how many bots are reading it every five seconds. I don't know and I don't (have to) care. Amazon just takes care of it. For very low cost.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, if it were easy or even possible (I suspect it's not possible) Amazon would have already offered me the option to switch. For another $5 a month I could turn http://scripting.com/ into https://scripting.com/. But they have not made that offer. Every time I've looked into it, the cost was prohibitive, the amount of time I'd have to put into it was also prohibitive, and the benefit, insignificant. Frankly if the Chinese want to add or remove stuff from my blog, go ahead, have a party. I'm sure they don't care. Honestly, I don't care either.&nbsp;</p><p>No money changes hands on any of my sites. I don't ask for credit card numbers or any information anyone could conceivably think of requiring security. When you log on to one of my sites, you're using Twitter's identity system, and they use HTTPS so if it's secure, then so am I.</p><p>But apparently HTTPS is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=https+security+issues&amp;oq=https+security+issues&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.3807j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8\">not secure</a>. Apparently there are holes in it. So please tell me this is more than security theater? I think the proponents of HTTPS are being as honest with us as the <a href=\"http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/01/tsa-business-security-theater-not-security/357599/\">TSA</a>, which is to say not very honest.&nbsp;</p><p>My net take -- it's a pointless fire drill. We're meant to prove that we're really here taking care of our sites. But I have a couple dozen sites that are just archives of projects that were completed a long time ago. I'm one person. I don't need make-work projects, I like to create new stuff, I don't need to make Google or Mozilla or the EFF or Nieman Lab happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's have a discussion about this, but a realistic and respectful one. HTTPS is not the answer to a problem that I have. So I don't have any intention of adapting my sites to support it.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: Yes, I've heard about all the things that supposedly make it easy to support. They all have missing pieces. They may get you closer to supporting it, in certain situations, but none of them could take me all the way there without major work on my sites. See above for reasons why I'm not going to undertake that work.</p><p>PPS: A discussion on this emerged <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/401600120047399?comment_id=401666950040716&amp;notif_t=feed_comment\">on Facebook</a>.</p>",

I don't think they were joking though (if they were they would have put a wink in there somewhere).

So I can have a website, and so can anyone else.</p><p>Facebook, a silo, is different. It's a very powerful communication tool. When I post my writing to Facebook it accomplishes more than if I post it to my site, it's more influential, but that comes at a cost. The fidelity of the content is not preserved, and it's not possible to use that content to bootstrap new more powerful ways of communicating. That's why the Internet is stagnating.</p><p>Key point: Mark Zuckerberg can have a Facebook, but he's the only one who gets to do that. It doesn't interoperate with other things like itself. I don't get to have a Facebook, and you don't either. Just Zuck.</p><p>And there are lots of other silos that are un-Internet-like, and as a result new kinds of linking and content that behave like the Internet, which held so much promise, have stopped coming. The web was great when it came along, but that's already over 25 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>If we want more, it has to come in the form of the Internet, not a silo, and that will be hard to do, and every day it gets harder.</p><p>That's the basic idea that I explore in this podcast.

If we created a new generation of humans to follow us, that was enough meaning. So we went on having kids, and inventing new technologies that made survival even more likely.&nbsp;</p><p>Until something happened. We crossed a line. The old way we defined survival no longer was the issue. We had medicine, and sewage systems, heating and air conditioning. Survival on the original terms was a done deal. So we went for comfort, and entertainment and drugs to distract us from the fact that our lives no longer had any meaning. We were just, as a friend put it, all waiting for the grim reaper. From birth. There was no purpose, no meaning.</p><p>That lasted a few generations, until survival of the species was once again an issue. It's forecast to be in the low 70s on Christmas Eve in NYC this year. Antibiotics aren't working. And people turn to extremism and hate to find meaning. We live with a dim future as a species, and therefore as individuals. None of our ritual changes.

Sure it might be more convenient in some ways. You can meet people in the lobby, says Hilton. But it's nice to have your own place. Hotel restaurants usually suck. And sometimes you want to be on your own, without all those other people around. I think at one point they did think everyone would move into hotels. Didn't happen.</li><li>If Ev is right then everyone must use mass transit instead of driving their own cars. Heh.</li><li>If everyone will be publishing to Medium and Facebook then it'll be Facebook. Why would anyone choose Medium? They're infinitesimal compared to Facebook. Everyone uses Facebook. Seriously, most people, even avid Twitter users, have never heard of Medium.&nbsp;</li><li>Eventually there will be features you can't get from the silos, because they are controlled by corporations who won't want users to have certain features. The web is great because of the freedom.</li><li>I like that I can add features to my own website. When I get an idea for Facebook, I'm stuck. I can suggest that they implement it, but they never do. I've been down this road so many times. Eventually monocultures stagnate.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, Ev, that's old hype. It didn't happen. People are still publishing to blogs. Twitter still has its 140-char limit. If you want to read something good, it's probably on a blog, still. Ev has been pushing this idea for years now. I would have hesitated before to say he's wrong, but not any more. He's wrong.</li></ol><p>And by the way, why can't we publish to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davewiner/the-web-is-better-than-your-silo-ev-9f3d2fa6848b#.r1aitm9da\">his silo</a> and our own sites?

You've earned yours over time, and invested time and energy building a platform people follow on the \"open web.\" While I'd like to believe traffic flows to content worthy of attention (at least over the long run) the fact is there are lots of people with something substantive to contribute on a given topic or question who lack either the skill or the sustained will required to be visible. Platforms like Medium help, combining a social overlay with powerful and well-integrated discovery features.</p>",

I was really surprised when I read this, but he's got a really good point, that gerrymandering is hurting the Republican Party as much as it is hurting the Democratic Party, if not more.</p><p>In Ohio they set things up so that the Republicans have a 12-4 majority of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_delegations_from_Ohio\">House seats</a>, even though they're just <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Ohio\">half</a> the population. The same thing has happened in states that were controlled by Republican legislatures after the last census, in 2010. This has meant that the Republican Party, even though it's not the majority party in the US, has a lock on control of one of the houses of Congress.&nbsp;</p><p>Now the problem is that the way things are set up, all of the Republican seats are still vulnerable to challenges from more and more extreme candidates. That's where the lunacy in the Republican Party is coming from. It's why a small minority of the population has extraordinary power in Washington.</p><p>The Senate was already tilted to the Republicans because they tend to control less populous states that each have the same representation in the Senate as the most populous ones. So a state like Wyoming, that has a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=wyoming+population&amp;oq=wyoming+population&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3615j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8\">population</a> of a small <a href=\"http://longisland.newsday.com/templates/simpleDB/?pid=197\">county</a> in New York State has just as much voice in the Senate as the whole of New York.</p><p>I'm sure this isn't making Kasich a lot of friends among incumbents in Ohio House seats, because they have to look even more extreme than they already are, which is saying a lot, to head off the challenges that are coming in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>But until we bite this bullet, government in the US is going to be lunatic.</p><p>No matter what, it's a brilliant tactic, at least, by Kasich to throw out a lifeline to more sanity-oriented Republicans, saying \"I'm not crazy\" like Trump nor crazy like Christie or Cruz, or just a nasty fuck like Rubio or a spineless oligarch like Jeb Bush.</p>",

Why won't we destroy Mars too? Isn't the more difficult problem figuring out how to live and grow in a way that does not consume our home? What if we destroy Mars too?

Yours is ultimately a false choice, since going to Mars will mean developing innumerable technologies that will likely be able to solve problems here.

If, for example, I were to make a change to this story after Medium picked it up, those changes would not appear on Medium.</span></li><li><span>Google really hurt the blogosphere with the dominance of Reader and then its shutdown.

There's no award ceremony, no prize, no testimonial other than a blog post <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/30/0759.html\">here</a> on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">Scripting News</a>. Such as the one you're reading right now.</p><p>The first year, <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com/awards/2001/\">2001</a>, I nominated several bloggers, and the readers chose the winner via a web poll -- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky\">Joel Spolsky</a>, who was at that time blogging prolifically about writing software.&nbsp;</p><p>He was doing what I had come to understand what <a href=\"http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/05/15/iHadMyOwnBlogForAWhile.gif\">blogging</a> was about:</p><p></p><ul><li><span>He wrote as an individual, edited only by himself.</span></li><li><span>He shared his experience and expertise.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><p>There isn't a single personality trait all the BOTY's share other than their desire to share what they know and see. As I've said in the past, if you need a <a href=\"http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/01/27/63900005.jpg\">volunteer</a> and there's a blogger in the room, you won't have to wait long. They can be conservative or liberal. Rich or poor. They can be unemployed, self-employed, or work for a great newspaper. Any race, any gender, any kind of person writing publicly, as long as it involves&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;their own knowledge and <a href=\"http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2009/01/24/born.gif\">perspective</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To be my BOTY, I don't even have to agree with you on much of anything. In <a href=\"http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/bloggerOfTheYear2012\">2012</a>, I chose <a href=\"https://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/\">Philip Greenspun</a>, a brilliant technologist, whose political opinions are abhorrent to me. But he's a wonderful advocate, and he listens if you tell him he's wrong. He stimulates thought, and underneath his Neanderthal politics lies a brilliant mind, so there's hope!&nbsp;</p><p>Last year I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/12/26/bloggerOfTheYear.html\">chose</a> the people who blog on Facebook. No single person comes to the front. But I wanted to say that while Facebook is a silo, and that's generally a blog-killing thing, there are <i>people</i> who use Facebook for blogging, and some of it is excellent and inspiring. I wanted to honor them.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/24/bloggerOfTheYear.html\">2007</a> I chose my friend <a href=\"http://www.nakedjen.com/\">NakedJen</a>. She was going through a tough year, as so many of us were and are now. Life is not a straight line. She wrote about it openly, without fear, as she would say, fiercely. To everyone whose life collapsed in 2015, there are no guarantees, but there's a good chance next year will be better, and even better for all the pain you went through this year. Growth and pain go together, perhaps unfortunately.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Sunrise <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebtC3ORg9fU\">doesn't</a> last all morning</i></p><p><span><i>A cloudburst doesn't last all day</i></span></p><p><i>Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning</i></p><p><i>It's not always going to be this grey&nbsp;</i></p><p>You can go through the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+blogger+of+the+year&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+blogger+of+the+year&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.6597j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8\">list</a> of all past BOTY choices.&nbsp;I find these pieces are good markers in time. They show not just where my friends the bloggers are going, but where we have come from, and perhaps provide a clue for where we're going.</p><p><br></p><h4>BOTY 2015</h4><p>Enough pre-ramble!&nbsp;</p><p>On with this year's choice.&nbsp;</p><p>The early years of blogging, for me, from 1994 to say 2005, are kind of a haze. Things moved quickly. Every year more bloggers came on line. Every year new tools, new communication frameworks. We were building an ecosystem without a center. The design of the blogosphere mirrored the design of the web. There is no home page for the web, and there was no home page for the blogosphere either.</p><p>There were lots of home pages. Because mine was the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html\">bootstrap</a> blog, I got the people who would go on to start their own blogs, and people who would start companies around blogging tech. Eventually there was lots of segmentation, there was a political blogosphere, then by geography, culture, technology, you name it. In each of these worlds there was generally one blogger who served as an anchor. His or her blogroll was the place you needed to be. A link from this person would send huge flow.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though we were creating the new layer of networking software, there was no network that connected all the blogospheres. So you would hear people say that Andrew Sullivan was the inventor of blogging. To people in his world it seemed that way. But there were lots of other <i>blogfathers.&nbsp;</i></p><p>So, in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2005/05/07.html\">2005</a> I was at a blogging conference in Nashville, sitting in a restaurant, with other bloggers coming and going. I did a <a href=\"http://mp3.morningcoffeenotes.com/cnMay7.mp3\">podcast</a> with two of them, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bhgreeley?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Brendan Greeley</a> who I knew from Berkman, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Derakhshan\">Hossein Derakhshan</a>, the Iranian blogfather, also known as Hoder.&nbsp;It's so cool to have a voice record of that meeting. (An aside, listening to the podcast now, I wish I could poke the 2005 version of myself and say Dave, let the other guys talk more!)</p><p>Hoder was&nbsp;arrested&nbsp;in Tehran in 2007. He spent the next seven years in jail. No Internet, no web, no blogosphere, no Facebook, no Twitter. It didn't look like he was coming back, but he was released in late 2014, and earlier this year, we read a stirring post from Hoder on Medium. It was like reading the diary of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle\">Rip Van Winkle</a>, awoken from a long sleep and shocked to find out how much the world had changed. How much of the change was for the worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Please read the piece <a href=\"https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426#.irehdjvp8\">on Medium</a>. A similar piece by Hoder ran yesterday in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/29/irans-blogfather-facebook-instagram-and-twitter-are-killing-the-web\">the Guardian</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We watched this happen in slow motion. We know in detail why and how we ceded control of the flow of discourse to tech companies. And how they used that flow to enrich themselves, and in doing so killed the crazy <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=cacophony\">cacophony</a> of the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/21/0682.html\">web</a>, the fertile environment for the exchange of ideas. They congratulate themselves for grabbing the money we left on the table. We saw it happen slowly, but Hoder saw it all at once. That's why his perspective is so valuable.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Even though it's only for one post, he is the clear choice for this year's Blogger of the Year.</span></p><p>Let's hope that at the end of 2016 we can write about the modest rebirth of the blogosphere, without all that ownership. Such <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/27/0724.html\">vision</a> is not unprecedented.&nbsp;</p>",

Suppose I want to subscribe to the RSS feed for this site. Count the number of steps to do this.(I just did it, it took 6 steps.)</p><p>In Twitter if I want to follow someone, I just click on the Follow icon and it’s done. (It’s gotten a bit more complex over the years, but not much.)</p><p>We identified that problem before there were other RSS aggregators and came up with a proposal for everyone to follow to make it easy, but they all invented their own buttons. I’m sure you remember the crazy mess of icons on websites, for a period, until people gave up on it.</p><p>Also if you look at how the vendors supported RSS, they were creating their own namespaces with data in them that could have been represented just as easily using the common elements. Apple was the worst with their iTunes namespace. So writing an aggregator kept getting more complicated. Then there was the proliferation of RSS versions. And the flaming on the mail lists (if this goes on much longer, the flaming will show up here too).</p><p>Google Reader came much later, and it did it’s own number on RSS by first dominating, sucking in all the other readers to their runtime and then shutting down. They couldn’t have done more damage if they tried</p>",
