I love that about Scoble. He has strong opinions and states them with vigor. I felt sorry for Bijan, who is soft-spoken though powerful, a good listener and as much an influencer as Scoble.&nbsp;</p><p>I differ with Scoble on <i>why</i> you should be on Facebook, but not that you should be there.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine being a music industry insider in the 60s and not listening to the Beatles. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band\">Sgt Pepper</a> just came out, you didn't care for it. Too much like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubblegum_pop\">bubblegum</a>. Not serious enough. I might as well listen to The Archies or The Turtles, you say. So you stop listening to the Beatles.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is that the Beatles were clearly having a huge influence on music, and more than that, the culture around them. And that was just beginning. What was still to come: Magical Mystery Tour, Abbey Road, The White Album, Let It Be, Hey Jude. They had not yet written Mother Nature's Son or My Guitar Gently Weeps.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to be current with tech as it goes forward, you must be in the loop on what's happening on Facebook, if only because <i>every person you hope to sell technology to in the future is using it.</i> They will judge everything in relation to what they have experienced on Facebook. It doesn't matter if Zuck isn't Paul McCartney or Lennon or Mick Jagger or Keith Richards, his product is that, and actually more.</p><p>I've been listening to interviews with John Lennon after the breakup of the Beatles, talking about how they were the biggest cultural phenomenon ever. Well that was true then, but they've been eclipsed by the combination of the iPhone and Facebook. They are even more influential culturally worldwide than the Beatles. When John Lennon said they were more popular than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_popular_than_Jesus\">Jesus Christ</a> he was right. And Facebook is more popular than the Beatles.</p><p>So someday, if you withdraw from Facebook, you will face a competitor who embraced it, and you will lose. That's why you should be there.</p>",

        "text": "<p>The idea of denting the universe bothers me, as does the idea of a person setting out to change the world.&nbsp;</p><p>What if two people are trying to change the world in opposite ways. So they battle it out and maybe one of them wins and the world changes the way this person wanted it to. Then a few years later the person is forgotten and a few years after that, dead.&nbsp;</p><p>What exactly did changing the world get you? Did it make your name ring down through the ages? If so, why would you care. It's the dream of adolescents to make a name for themselves. As you grow older it's not as important, you'll find, as it used to be.&nbsp;</p><p>I often wonder why a man as old as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Adelson\">Sheldon Adelson</a>, for example, wants to do anything to the world? He won't have to live with the changes he brings about. With the kind of money he has he actually can make changes to the world. I think there should be a law against people doing that. I'm not kidding. Adelson might be old, but in the grand scheme of things, you and I are pretty old too. Think about it when you're thinking about how great it would be to change the world. If you really do manage to change it, will you even live long enough to see what happens? My guess is probably not.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Denting the universe is even worse than changing the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Denting is something a car does when it hits something. Denting is damage. People get hurt when things are dented. And please, you're not going to even get remotely close to doing <i>anything</i> to the universe. The universe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p86BPM1GV8M\">exists</a> on a scale that you can't even begin to comprehend if you're dreaming of doing something to it. The universe just laughs at your ambition. Hah! You're a mere speck of dust, says the universe, a speck that exists for an infinitesimally short period of time.</p><p>I didn't want to write anything about this until I had a better idea, and now I do. Don't try to change the world. Instead, try to work with other people. Do something nice that won't change anything in any lasting way. Like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOBdefWr4b4\">rule</a> of hikers: Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints. I think that should apply as much as possible to life. Observe. Think. Share your experience, but strive to not change a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>We humans are too good at denting our own home, and because of that it's now become barely liveable. So less is more in the denting the universe department. It's better to just be kind to each other.&nbsp;<span>Your name may not ring down through the ages, but at least you will have lived a good life that you can be proud of.&nbsp;</span></p>",

But given enough time, and docility of users, the tech industry is getting close to locking this up too. But there's hope because finally journalism sees what's happening.</p><h4>Twitter as a silo</h4><p>In Slate, Will Oremus <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/01/05/twitter_isn_t_raising_the_140_character_limit_it_s_building_a_wall.html\">writes</a>, re the&nbsp;easing of Twitter's 140-char limit.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Instead of funneling traffic to blogs, news sites, and other sites around the Web, the “read more” button will keep you playing in Twitter’s own garden.</blockquote><p><span>I agree, this is Twitter wanting to suck all our writing into their platform. But they didn't invent the idea, so don't blame Jack. He's just matching Facebook, and I fully endorse what they're doing.&nbsp;</span><span>I want Twitter to achieve parity with Facebook.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I want them to go beyond and allow simple </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\">Markdown</a><span> features. Bold, italic, linking. Let posts have titles. It's not the Twitter we started with in 2006. But take another look at Twitter today, it's already moved quite a distance from its simple beginnings. That's the way platforms evolve.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I want Twitter and Facebook to become better platforms for news, but at the same time the open web must get an upgrade too.&nbsp;</p><h4>What do do?</h4><p><span>Now that journalism sees what's happening, and their fear is starting to rise, what to do about it? Believe it or not, there is <i>plenty</i> to be done.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><ol><li>First, stop giving over hosting of our creativity to tech companies with vague business models. I'm thinking of Medium. It costs virtually nothing to store a public essay on the web. I strongly urge a foundation or university to back a project to provide the ease and elegance of Medium without the lock-in. We totally know how to do it. With platforms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js\">Node.js</a> and open source projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor\">medium-editor</a>, we have all the basic technology we need. I would use Amazon S3 to store the writing, though there are plenty of other approaches. Key point: we should not be giving up any future for the open web for the tiny cost of web hosting for writing.&nbsp;</li><li><span>Second, build open distribution systems to compete with Facebook and Twitter. People laughed at Hulu when they launched to compete with YouTube, but it worked! And Netflix is growing like a weed. Tech companies are good at bluster, and they do it because it works. But Facebook is not established in news yet. There's still time, if there's a will, to put together many open distribution systems of all variety, to build on the power of the open web.</span></li></ol><p></p><h4>Feed the open web</h4><p><span>Tech is like all other industries. They're consuming natural resources and turning them into shareholder value. But what's left when they're done will be useless. Imagine journalism that tries to exist within a silo. It just doesn't work, and I suspect most people fully get this, but have been hoping we will find some way out of the conundrum.&nbsp;</span></p><p>But there's another approach, commerce and freedom co-existing and building off each other. I have been reading about Central Park in New York, how the land was set aside early in the city's history, and how the city thrived around a central place that was open for all to enjoy. The most expensive real estate in the world is all around this miracle of human <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/27/0724.html\">vision</a>.</p><p>It's quite possible that Facebook will stop thriving once they fully consume the open web. I believe they need to exist within the context of an open environment. I think tech is short-sighted in this way. (I come from tech, btw.)</p><p>So, I say feed the web with tools that compete with those created by the tech industry and keep our options open. It's the only way, imho, that journalism on the net has a future free of control from the tech industry.</p>",

At the beginning of the web, users were mostly hackers, scholars, geeks&amp;freaks, and pretty well educated people who built and believed in a certain web ethics and liked to own and manage their own tools. Managing your own tools and keeping updated on what happens in, for instance this blog post after I finish my comment, is hard in the present world. Notifications, short characters range and a one and only stop as Facebook is nowadays, it is easier to handle. People and, unfortnatelly, old users have become lazy and they do prefer to have a single window to the world without the costs and complexity of managing their tools to follow and track every interaction of the people they are interested in for whatever reason. Facebook newsfeed algorithm is a better life for most of the folks out there. So we may well end up keeping a good open web working but only for minorities.&nbsp;</p>",

He's the kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_Guzm%C3%A1n\">person</a> we rarely hear directly from. That the story was reported by Sean Penn, who is not a professional journalist, is of no concern to me as a reader, as long as it's reasonably clear what happened. There are disclosures on the piece. Of course we can't know if everything was disclosed, we have to guess. Being a news reader involves a lot of this kind of guesswork.&nbsp;</p><p><span>I've been an insider enough to know that reporters sometimes don't disclose all their conflicts. There are times when you can't. I understand that.&nbsp;</span></p><p>As readers, we try to figure out how much to trust a report. Often it's not at all clear what the story really is, it's so obscured by all the egos that seem to have been tweaked. Pubs gain reputations. I tend to believe that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/\">Ars Technica</a>, for example, isn't worried about access, and I tend to believe some of the older business pubs are <i>totally</i> about <a href=\"http://www.seconddraft.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=91\">access</a>, and tend to not pay much attention. (Caveat: That doesn't mean I believe everything I read In Ars. Not at all. I had objections to their story about the origin of podcasting, for example.)</p><p><span>In tech, the high regard reporters have for people with big money has led to a market defined by silos and lock-in. It's shameful how this medium has been handed over to the super-rich, and the people who did the handing are also some of the people who are complaining about Rolling Stone.</span></p><p>I would like journalists to accept that news comes from all directions now. Readers are not docile non-participants. I think that's part of what makes the Trump phenomenon so disturbing to the real conservatives, people invested in the current political system -- the incumbents of journalism and politics.&nbsp;</p><p>That's why Twitter is such a phenomenon among news makers. It does flatten the playing field as we predicted it would. And because the existing political and economic structures haven't adjusted well, it means change comes in fits and starts.</p><p>The El Chapo piece will probably be considered historic not because it's an interview with a news maker that typically we never get to hear from, but rather that it happened at all, and that was largely made possible by the new technology.&nbsp;</p><p><span>My guess is there will be more to say about this.&nbsp;</span></p><p>PS: This post came as a result of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/686211633262231552\">comment</a> I made to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/mathew-ingram/\">Mathew Ingram</a> about his criticism of this story. Part of the reason I wrote this is I wanted to get to the heart of my concern, which clearly couldn't have fit in 140 chars. Ingram's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/686240606398640128\">response</a>.</p>",

Yet it impacts everything about what it means to be in the news business today.</span></p><p>I describe the change as <i>Sources Go Direct.</i></p><p>What it means is that now the newsmakers and the people who want news are directly connected.&nbsp;</p><p>The newsmakers don't need the intermediaries to reach the people who they influence.&nbsp;</p><p>I've understood this longer than most because the press stopped believing that my software had a market right around the time I discovered the web. So with nothing to lose, I decided to try to talk directly to the people I cared about, at first via email, and then through the web, and it worked!&nbsp;</p><p>And why wouldn't it. The problem for each of us individually was that owning a news publishing system was prohibitively expensive. In the early 90s I was selling automation software for corporate publishers. But with the web, something fundamental had changed. The cost of production and distribution was so low that now anyone could do it. That function of the news industry was economically obsolete at that point, by the mid 90s.</p><p>These transitions take a while to work their way through an economy and society. But nowadays no one can argue that newsmakers use Twitter to speak to their audience, and that includes the press. If you have something to say, you don't call the editor at the local paper, you go to Twitter and shout it to the world. It happens instantly, without filters (another important reason to go direct).</p><p>There was an opportunity before Twitter to be the hosting environment for newsmakers. And because Twitter has been slow to adapt to that role, almost doesn't seem to understand that they own something valuable, the opportunity isn't fully closed off.</p><p>Had Hughes, instead of trying to make it work with the existing editorial model, decided instead to be a platform for progressive thought, open to a much larger group of people, I suspect it would have worked. But he hadn't factored that into his thinking.</p><p>I know it has been tried, Huffington Post allows a large number of people to post, myself included. But it wasn't managed well, imho. Forbes seems to operate the same way, again -- I don't find myself happy to find out that a link ends at Forbes. I usually hit the Back button right away. Medium is doing a much better job, and has gained a lot of traction.</p><p>Imho there need to be lots of Mediums. Each with a separate, identifiable position. The idea of a Medium-in-a-box makes a lot of sense.</p>",

Having recently listened to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=lennon+interview+mike+douglas+show\">interviews</a> with John Lennon in the 70s, when he was in his 30s, post-Beatles, I would be fascinated to listen to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=bowie+interview\">interviews</a> with Bowie. We're all kind of going to school on him, now that we own him.</p><p>How strange it is reading his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/arts/music/david-bowie-dies-at-69.html\">obit</a> to feel envy. I had to scold myself. His life is past-tense, you're still living yours. There's nothing to feel envy of. But I feel it anyway.</p><p>There are only two ways to process death, I think, someone else's and your own. I've faced death a few times, a couple of times as an adult and conscious of the likelihood. That's very personal. But someone else's death is also personal. It's impossible to experience it any other way. I've tried.&nbsp;</p><p>Bowie was an artist to the end. I hope to be able to say the same about myself, in the afterlife, if there is one. ;-)</p>",

One of the things I asked about is why she refers to me as a \"blogging pioneer.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Because that's what you are,\" she replied.</p><p>Well I am also a former softball player, and a sometime skier.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm a food eater and a bike rider. I walk and ride the subway. I used to drive a car, but don't anymore. I started an underground newspaper when I was in high school.&nbsp;</p><p>We are all lots of things, but how a reporter chooses to characterize you has a lot to do with how they see you, and how readers will view your ideas. You're saying in a few words what the person's point of view is. It's quite important.</p><p>She then asked how would I like to be credited.</p><p>Well, I'm first and foremost a software developer. So if you refer to me as that I will not have a complaint. It's like saying Sean Penn is an actor and director, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi%C5%86%C4%A3is\">Kristaps Porzingis</a> is a basketball player. Most important is that&nbsp;<span>\"software developer\" is present tense. It's what I am now.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I also am a writer, and I think that's important.&nbsp;</p><p>So the simplest, least glamorous way to refer to me is thus: Software developer and blogger. I know saying one is a blogger is pretty commonplace, but I do spend as much time writing on my blog as I do writing software. And as has been pointed out I am a blogging <i>pioneer,</i> and I am still doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Over <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/01/12/prominent.png\">on</a> Medium, I was just <a href=\"https://medium.com/3-to-read/3-to-read-home-page-help-from-mobile-time-to-care-about-the-open-web-exploring-messaging-apps-118dd10eb31c#.4hnaaw864\">referred to</a> as a \"prominent technologist and sometime media critic.\" Now I really like that. Prominent! Oh yeah. That means the author <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=define+prominent&amp;oq=define+prominent&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3359j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8\">respects</a> me, and thinks that other people do as well.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Blogging pioneer\" sounds so much like \"silent film star.\"&nbsp;</p><p>My blogging pioneer days are in the past. Perhaps after I'm dead if you want to cite my work you could refer to me as that. Or when I hang up the software development thing and retire to a bike farm in Puerto Rico, or to make pottery in Tuscany. Then who can argue that my software work is past tense. But I shipped a lot of software last year, and hope to do the same this year. Part of the reason no one looks, imho, is this idea that my life is over and my work is done. I hear that so often that it's really time to call it out. I am very actively working on the tech I write about. So please, do me a favor, and take that work seriously.</p>",

What happens when you take a small-town approach to getting around in NYC.</p><p>The other night I was coming home from a dinner party on the east side, midtown, and that meant I had to walk through the tourist-heavy part of the city, between Times Square in the south and Carnegie Hall in the north. I always try to avoid walking through this area, because a lot of tourists don't know how to walk properly in a city as dense as New York.&nbsp;<span>Lots of near-misses, as they stroll three-across, arm-in-arm, looking at a tourist map or taking a selfie while they're walking.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Another scene -- a group of four or five, looking at a map or a phone, discussing something, blocking the whole sidewalk on 5th Ave in front of the <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/cartier-at-saks-fifth-avenue-new-york\">Cartier</a> watch store. They left a tiny sliver of space between the group and the street, and as I headed for that space, of course, they started moving toward it too. At a conscious level I'm sure they had no idea what was going on around them, that a dozen people were trying to get around them every few seconds. You can probably get away with this in the parking lot of a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=walmart%20little%20rock\">Walmart</a> in Little Rock. But it doesn't work on a busy street like Fifth Ave in NY.&nbsp;</p><p>I try to imagine what this must look like to them. I totally understand if they don't like us. It's not so much that we don't like <i>them, </i>but they really do get in the way.&nbsp;</p><p>My guess is that in his heart Mr Trump feels the same way about non-NYers.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Today I made it so the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/15/0876.html\">story pages</a> here load quite a bit faster. &nbsp;</p><p>For those who are interested in web technology I'd like to explain what happened. If you don't care, please hit the Back button. ;-)</p><p>Pages on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">Scripting News</a>\n have come in all flavors of dynamic and static. Static pages of course load really fast, and dynamic pages can load slowly esp if there's a heavy load on the server, or some table gets very big, or whatever. Dynamic pages are less reliable, so in recent iterations I've been going fully static.</p><p>But there's a feature in Facebook and Twitter that I really like, when you load something, if it changes while the user is reading it, it updates on the user's screen. There's a bit of background communication going on with the server, so the server can tell the page \"Hey here's some new stuff, you can show it to the user.\" Or something like that.</p><p>I wanted something slightly different here -- liveblogging.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you have the page open and I update the post, you have to do nothing to see the updated version. No flicker, no scrolling, it's sometimes so subtle you don't even see it. I thought it would be possible to have the live features be more human-friendly. And it works, if you happen to be reading while I am editing, you should see it change. Thanks to the miracle of WebSockets, a very rational technology that works well in the mainstream browsers of 2016. It's good.&nbsp;</p><p>So the natural way to do things when someone loads the page is to send a websocket call to the server, let it send back the update and then show it to the user. But it's a bit more complicated. At startup with all the caches empty, it also has to make requests to the server to get info about the author and to tell it to load the author's chatlog before we make a call that loads the content. Some of that can be optimized too. The server is very fast, but there's enough of a delay in starting up that you feel it when you load the page.</p><p>Luckily there's an object baked into the page called the pagetable, and in it there's an object called item, and it has a full, but possibly old, copy of the message that we're going to get from the server. It's a snapshot taken the last time the page was statically rendered. It really can't be too old, and anyway the first thing we do after showing it to the reader is do the dance with the server to set up the socket so it can inform us of updates which it will do as soon as we've properly shaken hands.&nbsp;</p><p>So it's static, and dynamic. That's what I wanted: the benefits of both approaches without the costs.</p><p>It also accounts for the possibility of a server outage or it outright disappears. The static version will be what you see. And&nbsp;<span>there's an invisible-to-the-reader rendering in the page just for Google et al to index.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So the net effect is we get all the benefits, reliability and performance of a static page, and the best-in-the-industry live connection. Even Facebook doesn't update stories in realtime when they change, and as you know you can't even edit Twitter posts.&nbsp;</p>",

Of course they know and agree that all lives matter. But that isn't what they're saying. They're saying that <i>Black</i> Lives Matter not because they're more important than white lives or cop lives, which seems to be how you're interpreting it, but because a lot of black people are being killed and the justice system does not seem to care.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we all know that if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin\">Trayvon Martin</a>, for example, had been a white teen, and George Zimmerman had been a black adult man, the outcome would have been different. But because he was black, and black lives <i>don't</i> matter, Martin is dead and Zimmerman is free.</p><p>There have been a seemingly endless series of graphic stories, many of them on video, of white police killing black people, and getting off. I suspect this has been going on all along, but now with the wide use of smartphones, we're actually seeing it, visually, as we couldn't have seen it before. Now it's not their word against a cop's. The video provides testimony that is impossible to refute.&nbsp;</p><p>If you were black, and you saw this happening, you might be inspired to do more than say something like Black Lives Matter. Your rage and fear might overwhelm you. So the first thing I would say to a black person who said Black Lives Matter is thank you for containing the rage you must feel, that I would feel if I were in your shoes, that I feel in a small way on your behalf, at the cruelty and callousness of our system and culture. Then I'd ask if there was anything I could do to help.</p>",

I edited it after re-posting here.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Thanks for <a href=\"https://medium.com/@wob/the-sad-state-of-web-development-1603a861d29f#.9yte56mvj\">posting this</a>. I was disappointed to see it disappear, but I can only imagine the kinds of abuse you had to put up with.</p><p>Collectively, we spend a huge amount of time working with frameworks, or trying to understand code written using a framework we’ve never used. Your post helped me put together how other people, not just me, are grappling with this.</p><p>But you only see this if you want to build more reliable and functional tools for users. If you look at an app and see a only a bunch of code, then the only kind of improvement you can see is to the code itself.</p><p>My software projects take years to complete. If the foundation changes radically while I’m working, I don’t even notice. I stay focused on the problem I’m working on, with the constraints I’ve accepted.</p><p>But at the other end of the pipe I have to deal with the possibility that the platform I’m using is no longer supported. I feel pretty comfortable about that with JavaScript on both sides.</p><p>In my JavaScript work, the only frameworks I use are jQuery and Bootstrap. I don’t update them. I leave them right where they are. I think of them as peripheral, I’m still basing my work on the machine presented to me by the browser and by Node. I also use Font-Awesome. Very useful.</p><p>On the server I work in Node, and use packages to parse XML files, to access Amazon web services, WebSockets, and to interface to the Twitter API. I don’t add many other packages to <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories\">my apps</a>, and only if I see they’ve been stable for quite a while, and if people seem to like them in Stack Exchange posts.</p><p>One of the packages I’ve bet on recently is <a href=\"https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor\">medium-editor</a>. I’m using it as the basic text editor in a chat/blogging system I’m working on. It’s not overwhelming but it adds <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/01/18/mediumEditor.png\">features</a>, borrowed from Medium, that should be part of basic web text editing, imho.</p><p>I’m in favor of things that make the platform better for users. My users are largely writers.</p><p>So I do use frameworks, but very carefully and never defining the machine I’m developing for. That’s basic JavaScript. Nothing fancy.</p><p>Please keep writing about this stuff. It’s really helpful!</p>",

Their philosophy of documentation seems to be to show you everything the package can do in all its detail before saying how it might fit in with your development work. (This is common in tech docs. I'm looking for a good <i>simple</i> summary of what's in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=es6\">ES6</a>, but they all assume right at the top that I understand terminology that I don't understand.)</p><p>There have been some attempts with Lambda to shorten the learning curve, and this is appreciated. A simple <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=aws+lambda+node+hello+world&amp;oq=aws+lam&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j0l3.2976j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Hello World</a> for a Node developer that shows me how to go from a project on my desktop to a service running in the cloud would be welcome.&nbsp;</p><p>I could imagine using it for some of the simple services I have running, like one that just gets the dimensions of an image, and later I could see deploying sophisticated server apps. But getting started is the hardest part of any of these projects.</p><p>It was no different for JavaScript btw. I got lucky there and hooked up with an excellent programmer who knew his way around and got tutored for a few months. That's why communities of developers are so important.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Last night I posted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/689672660675121152\">tweet</a>: \"Next time you want to post an essay to Medium, do the open web a favor and post it elsewhere. Anywhere. Tumblr. WordPress.com.\"&nbsp;</p><p>If I had more space I would have added Pastebin or Blogger. Really anywhere but Medium.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn't have room to explain, but people asked, so here's where that tweet came from.</p><p>Over on Facebook, Steven Max Patterson wrote a long well-thought-out <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/409275095946568?comment_id=409418535932224&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R1%22%7D&amp;pnref=story\">comment</a> about Trump, jobs and how he's not wrong about the policies he's advocating. He also went out of his way to say he doesn't support Trump.&nbsp;</p><p>It was so well written, it seemed a waste to bury it in a comment on Facebook, where almost no one would see it. You can't publish pointers to Facebook posts or comments, because you never know who might not be able to see it. I've never been able to fully figure out how this works. So I suggested he post the comment to a blog so I could give it greater circulation by pushing it through my network.</p><p>In the back of my mind I thought that he'll probably put it on Medium. But I didn't want to say anything up front. Who knows, he might put it somewhere else.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, he did put it on Medium and sent me a link, and I sent back a comment saying that I was worried he'd do that, and unfortunately while I love his post I am reluctant to point to it on Medium. I asked if he'd consider putting it somewhere else. He asked where else. Hence the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/689672660675121152\">tweet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Medium is on its way to becoming the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/chinesehouseholdrevisited.html#5\">consensus platform</a> for writing on the web. if you're not sure you're going to be blogging regularly, the default place to put your writing is Medium, rather than starting a blog on Tumblr or WordPress.com, for example. I guess the thought is that it's wasteful to start a blog if you're not sure you're going to post that often. It's something of a paradox, because blogs are not large things on the storage devices of the hosting companies. If they're doing it right, a blog is smaller than the PNG image in the right margin of this post. They're tiny little things in a world filled with videos and podcasts and even humble images. Text is very very very small in comparison.</p><p>People also post to Medium to get more flow. But at what cost? Which pieces get flow? Ones that are critical of Medium? I doubt it. Or offend the politics of the founder? I don't know. I don't see a statement of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/19/opinion/without-fear-or-favor.html\">principles</a>, tech startups usually don't have them. They're here to dominate and make money off the dominance. I'm very familiar with the thinking, having been immersed in it for decades.&nbsp;</p><p>Because I cross-post my stories to Medium through <a href=\"http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">RSS</a>, you will be able to read this <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davewiner/anywhere-but-medium-5450cb19f2c1#.2gv2klp7h\">there</a>. I guess they won't recommend it. It probably won't appear on the front page of Medium. See there's the other problem with ceding a whole content type to a single company. Since you're counting on them not just to store your writing, but also build flow for it, the inclination is to praise them, to withhold criticism. To try to guess what they like, and parrot it. If Medium becomes much stronger, this will be what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\">SEO</a> becomes. We saw that happen before on Twitter, when they gave huge flow to people they liked, and not to people they don't. Now they're being more open about it. Why not? It didn't appear to cost them anything the last time around.</p><p>If Medium were more humble, or if they had competition, I would relax about it. But I remember how much <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS</a>\n suffered for being dominated by Google. And Google was a huge company and could have afforded to run Google Reader forever at a loss. Medium is a startup, a well-funded one for sure, but they could easily pivot and leave all the stories poorly served, or not served at all. I'm sure their user license doesn't require them to store your writing perpetually, or even until next week.</p><p><span>I only want to point to things that I think have a chance at existing years from now. And things that are reasonably unconflicted, where I feel I understand where the author is coming from. Neither of those criteria are met by posts on Medium. I also want to preserve the ability of developers to innovate in this area. If Medium sews up this media type, if they own it for all practical purposes, as Google owned RSS (until they dropped it), then you can't move until they do. And companies with monopolies have no incentive to move forward, and therefore rarely do. Look at how slowly Twitter has improved their platform, and all the new features are for advertisers, not for writers. I suspect Medium will go down a similar path.&nbsp;</span></p><p>We can avoid this, it's not too late. You have a choice. Post your writing to places other than Medium. And when you see something that's interesting and not on Medium, give it some extra love. Push it to your friends. Like it on Facebook, RT it on Twitter. Give people more reasons to promote diversity on the web, not just in who we read, but who controls what we read.&nbsp;</p><p>We all point to tweets, me too, because it's too late for competition. And YouTube videos. SoundCloud MP3s. Do we really want to bury something as small and inexpensive as a web page? Is it necessary that a Silicon Valley tech company own every media type? Can we reserve competition in the middle of the web, so we get a chance for some of the power of an open platform for the most basic type of creativity -- writing?&nbsp;</p><p><span>When you give in to the default, and just go ahead and post to Medium, you're stifling the open web. Not giving it a chance to work its magic, which depends on diversity, not monoculture.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Anyway, the story had a happy ending. Patterson posted his <a href=\"https://stevep2007.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/trump-on-us-manufacturing-jobs-wrong-and-right-at-the-same-time/\">story</a> on WordPress.com. I circulated a link to it via my <a href=\"http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/\">linkblog</a>, so he got far more exposure than he would have gotten on Medium, and the open web got a little more of a future as a result.&nbsp;</p>",

I tried to \"educate\" my readers to post their feedback on my site to keep the threads together, but they can't even think about that. In the case they actually read the post and not just the nice title they \"like\" or retweet, they go back and write a few words on Facebook. I wonder if fighting to make people to keep their own space in the open web should also include a fight to keep comments in the original site. The fact that Medium, Facebook, Twitter and the like notify answers to comments in an easiest way than blogging platforms has a lot to do with this I guess.&nbsp;</p>",

I had them all copied into the iPhone via iTunes, ready to play in the Apple music app. Except when I opened the Music app on the subway it froze on the screen where they want me to sign up to their <a href=\"http://www.jewish-languages.org/jewish-english-lexicon/words/162\">farkakte</a> music service. Which I will never sign up to ever under any circumstances.</p><p>It stayed frozen there until I got home and installed the new version of iOS, which seemed to stir things up enough so that it woke up from its crash, and let me play my own music after dismissing the dialog. Yes I tried everything. I rebooted it. Pressed every pixel to see if it was waiting for me to do something.</p><p>Fuck Apple. I paid almost $1000 for this brick. All I want to do is listen to some fucking music while I'm walking around. No, they want me locked in even more, and to get me locked in they're willing to install some crashy crapware on my fucking phone that prevents it from even playing music, something iPods could do fine, by the way, in 2001 or 2002. About 15 years ago. When Steve was still alive, btw.</p><p>This shit sucks Apple. At least keep the fucking software working well enough to play a song or a podcast, and until you get that right oh please I need to stop now I get so pissed at them.</p>",

I did come across one guy riding in the park during the storm, but just the one.</p><p>This morning, I walked for two hours in the park, and I seriously thought about getting a bike and riding it home, but I didn't do it for two reasons:</p><p></p><ol><li><span>The CitiBike station I wanted to use was completely plowed over. I might have gotten a bike at another station, but then again.</span></li><li><span>Too many people were out, walking in the places bikes go. There were a few people out riding, but they were endangering not only themselves, which is acceptable, but endangering everyone else. That wasn't OK with me.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p></p><p>I think perhaps tomorrow, a weekday, it will make sense. But by then I expect the streets will be more or less completely clear, so it won't be a snow-riding experience, if that's the case.</p><p>It sounded good, but like a lot of things that sound good on the drawing board, the reality of it seemed completely different.&nbsp;</p>",

Two weeks later I looked at the Orders page on Amazon and saw it was still stalled at the last step. \"Looks like it's lost\" I concluded.</p><p>So I went looking for a Contact Us link anywhere on amazon.com. I spent 15 minutes going all over the place, for a $12 item, btw. No luck. So I posted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/691431206731259906\">question</a> on Twitter, and nine hours later, after claiming the link was obvious, an ex-Amazon PM gave me the link. I filled out the form. And within minutes got a reply back from an Amazon rep, apologizing and saying the package obviously is lost and they were refunding my money. Then they asked me to evaluate the service. This is what I wrote.</p><blockquote>I had to ask on Twitter if anyone could find a way to raise an issue with Amazon, and only after many hours did anyone find a link on your site.&nbsp;<span>I spend thousands with Amazon every year, check your records. If I have an issue to raise with you, it's something like this. I am offended that you make it so difficult to even send an email to Amazon. There should be a Contact Us link on every page.&nbsp;</span><span>And I have to ask why did I even have to contact you for this? The package was stalled at the endpoint for weeks. Why didn't your computers pick this up and fix the problem on your own, without making me go through the misery of having to find a way to contact you. Something is wrong with your service. You make it so easy to buy, but when there's a problem it's virtually impossible to find a way to communicate with you.</span></blockquote><p><span>I'll add here, this is probably a legal issue. To sell to the public yet have it be so difficult to report problems raises a serious question about the honesty of the company. Perhaps something for the FTC to look at.&nbsp;</span></p><p>PS: For future reference, here's a link to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=508510&amp;ref_=hp_gt_comp_cu&amp;\">Contact Us</a> page.&nbsp;</p><p>PPS: It's situations like this that make me seriously doubt whether the tech industry should be allowed to make self-driving cars. Can you imagine how you will ask for help when your car drives you to a dark place, at night, and just stops there, like my package did. You look around for a Contact Us link in the car, and find there is none. Now what.</p>",

But he was fairly honest about that. It was up to the people to have a revolution, not something he could do himself. I doubt it the Sanders supporters are willing to sacrifice anything to get what they want, but even if they were, you'd have to convince a lot of Republican voters to elect revolutionary Democrats in time for Sanders to accomplish the revolution he wants to have. There are so signs his supporters understand this.</p><p>I don't think Hillary is a poet, and she even alluded to that, several times quoting the <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mario_Cuomo\">Mario Cuomo</a> line that you campaign in poetry and govern in prose. When the young Sanders supporter asked why people call her a liar, she came close to nailing it -- when you do and say things that piss powerful people off, one of the things they do is smear you personally so people won't listen to you. But some great poetry snuck in there anyway, at the end when she explained her admiration for President Lincoln, who not only kept the country from splitting apart but also built the transcontinental railroad. So she says you can have vision while fighting the inevitable battles. There's no doubt she's ready to be President tomorrow. </p><p>Hopefully this will be Martin O'Malley's last debate. &nbsp;</p>",

I actually pay to access the NYT through their paywall. I bet I make money for them because I post so many links to their stories. Not that I'm trying to do that, I don't care if I do or don't.

I'll have to learn more about this.</p><p>But there is another approach, to have WordPress accept as input, the URL of a JSON file containing the source code for a post, and then do its rendering exactly as if that post had been written using WordPress's editor. That would give us exactly what we need to have the best of all worlds. Widespread syndication and control over our own writing and archive. All at a very low cost in terms of storage and CPU.&nbsp;</p><p>I wrote about this in an <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/24/0925.html\">earlier piece</a>.</p><p>Here's an <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/data/2016/01/26/00934.json\">example</a> of the JSON for this post. I'm already storing it publicly with my in-development blogging tool, 1999.io. Since it hasn't yet been deployed outside my own server there's still time to change the format, with relatively little breakage.</p><p>Just want to put this idea out there for people who are thinking about this stuff. APIs are not necessary. Just a new syndication format. We could even use an <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">existing format</a>, but since we're mostly working in JavaScript these days, I think JSON is also a fine way to go. ;-)</p>",

Compared to your JSON format, it would be “creator” not “name”, maybe “articleBody” instead of “text” (though they have “text” as well, a bit ambiguous), “datePublished” / “dateModified” instead of “when” / “whenLastUpdate” etc. What’s also interesting is <a href=\"http://json-ld.org/\">JSON-LD</a> which, with only minimal additional information, makes JSON conform to Linked Data principles.</p>",

The first version of how to do it was “the canonical version is on my harddrive in some reasonable format, WordPress is just for presentation to be discarded anytime” (even more important because WP pulverizes anything resembling HTML into his own disgusting mush). For that I started to use (and extended) <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/mcepl/b.py\">b.py</a> and used WP on my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2010/07/08/peopleHostingTheirOwnServe.html\">own server</a>.</p><p>Then inevitable happened: my server died, so I have to rebuild my site. My colleagues from work shared rented VPS so I joined them and pointed my domain to it. However, when I started to work on installing WP, I was caught again by my suspicions about WP. Do I really want to fight with pulverized HTML, zillion upgrades, comment spam, etc., when all I want from the server is to render my posts to HTML? So, I started to look for static web generators. After a brief affair with <a href=\"https://hexo.io/\">Hexo</a>&nbsp; (Server-side JavaScript looks like such a good idea, but it still so immature and unuseable!) I ended up with <a href=\"http://blog.getpelican.com/\">pelican</a>.</p><p>The only problem is of course the only dynamic part of my blog, which are comments. For now I have Disqus on my site as everybody else, but I am very unhappy with it. Sometimes, when I have time I will try to make <a href=\"https://posativ.org/isso/\">Isso</a> working for me, but I have failed so far.</p>",

This is my rebuttal.</i></p><p>Tech is cyclic. First there was an open platform, then silo-makers were able to build something higher level by foreclosing on the openness. Then they stagnate because big companies get stuck in the Way Things Always Have Been, and the users get skilled, a new generation comes along and they see how to make progress outside the silo and enough people use the new open system so it gains traction. It’s always more exciting than the stale corporate silos, so for a while they blossom, until the cycle repeats.</p><p>The winners of one cycle always think they see how to get to the next level without being open and they always end up very rich but off in a cul de sac far away from where the new stuff is happening.</p><p>I saw this happen, in my career, the first time with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Olsen\">winners</a> of the minicomputer era, who didn’t understand why people loved the underpowered PCs that could do a tiny fraction of what their big iron could do. (We loved the PC because it was ours to do with as we pleased.)</p><p>Then Bill Gates boasted he wouldn’t get stuck when the next thing came along he’d embrace it and he did, but it still rolled over him, as it had to, because he had too much invested in preserving his victory in the previous cycle. That story is fully documented in the early archive of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">this blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And so it goes. No one ever seems to escape the loop, though there is a way out of it, they are all super impressed with their success and believe it has to do with some innate superiority they have. But so were the founders of DEC and Microsoft and Google and even Facebook now. They were all super smart, and they all got stuck when they won. The only way out of it is to shed the results of victory and get back down in the trenches. That's what Steve Jobs did when Apple rebooted &nbsp;in 1997.</p><p>That’s why Ev is right and wrong. He was able to improve on RSS with Twitter because it controlled the subscription process. It was a much-needed improvement so Twitter caught fire. But it’s now ten years later. Enough time has passed, there’s a new generation around, and the cloud technology today is vastly better than it was ten years ago. Hold on, because the ride is about to get interesting. And Ev’s analysis just couldn’t be more wrong for today. It was right a few years ago, but we’re at a different point in the cycle now.</p>",

That's how software development processes work.&nbsp;</span><span>Version 1 is easy to get onboard because if it weren't there would be no version 2. Then the feature lists reflect the wants of the users (this is good!), and that's how the secret handshakes creep in.&nbsp;</span></p><p>For single-user software this isn't such a problem. I was always a very casual spreadsheet user, and used a tiny fraction of the feature set. It didn't matter to me if they kept adding features as long as I didn't have to use them.&nbsp;</p><p>The evolution of programming languages has the same problem. I had more or less figured out the features of JavaScript, until they came out with a <a href=\"http://caspervonb.com/javascript/an-overview-of-javascript-in-2015-ecmascript-6/\">new version</a> of the language late last year, and then there were lots of features I didn't grok. Not a problem until I have to read someone else's code that uses the new features. So you tend to get dragged along whether you want to or not. (The new features are very worthwhile additions, btw.)</p><p>I don't know if anyone has yet to figure out a solution for this. But it's yet another reason that tech is cyclic. Some bright creative developer might figure at this point, with Twitter becoming congested for experienced users and there being too much culture to absorb for newbies, that it might be a good time for a fresh start. Just re-read the recent <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/26/0936.html\">Tech is Cyclic</a> piece for a story of how that replacement works.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: A rebuttal to Mossberg's thesis. I find that Facebook has lots of secret handshakes too. I tend not to feel them in Twitter because I started near the beginning, in 2006. I was a much later arrival on Facebook, so the culture had already been through a number of iterations when I got there. I see little vestiges of its history here and there that more experienced users might not see.&nbsp;</p>",

But so far no one has been willing to look. I've been more or less alone in questioning the idea.</span></p><p><span>To think that people who set up blogging servers can jump through this hoop, no one can be so naive to think that won't hurt the open web. For what benefit? Please don't recite the standard talking points, I've heard them all before many times.</span></p><p>There's no doubt it will serve to crush the independent web, to the extent that it still exists. &nbsp;It will only serve to drive bloggers into the silos. Perhaps that's the real motive for Google et al.&nbsp;</p><p>Google did this before, with RSS, the loop is closed on that. So to assume their motives are good, or that they're competent to make these choices for us, is not true. They are a company. A very large one, and they behave like one.&nbsp;</p><h4>Update at 1PM</h4><p>A former exec at one of Google's competitors explained what is possibly their real motive. Google doesn't want its competitors to write bots that scrape their search engine.&nbsp;</p><p>So why not just encrypt all access to google.com? I asked.&nbsp;</p><p>Because bits of Google code are embedded in other people's pages. Google Analytics, YouTube, maps. I immediately understood. The way HTTPS works, if any component of a page is not secure then all other accesses are not.&nbsp;</p><p>I guess that means that google.com still has to be ready to handle unsecure requests, because some pages include references to it.&nbsp;</p>",

And it's not true, never was, that you either demo'd or died. And it takes all the fun out of it if the stakes are seen as that high, without throwing a little humor into it. Demo or die is not, in any way that I can see, funny.</span></li><li>At my first company, Living Videotext, started in the 80s, when there were all kinds of new styles of management, we invented <i>Management By Shipping. </i>That was the value of the company. Getting product into the hands of users so they could kick ass with it.&nbsp;</li><li>I also practiced <i>Management By Walking Around.</i> As the CEO, being accessible to everyone in the company was also a major value. I wanted to understand how my company worked, and believed that the people doing the work were in the best position to show me.&nbsp;</li><li>It makes sense that Joi would bring <i>Deploy!</i> to academia. He came from the blogosphere, he's one of our champions, where the focus was always on the people who use the stuff. Ideas are great, but until they are deployed they aren't helping anyone.&nbsp;</li><li><span>Academia is very much about publishing and demos, and not so much about deploying.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>In the blogosphere the focus was so much on the users (a good thing) that the software that made it possible sort of fades into the background (as all software should).</span></li><li>A popular slogan at my second company, UserLand, and on my own blog was <i>Let's Have Fun! </i>Although it may not seem so at first it has a dark side. There was a line in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Arrow_(1996_film)\">movie</a> with John Travolta and Christian Slater about high powered nuclear missiles. Slater has this great line at the beginning of the movie where he's showing Travolta a new weapon and says \"it's a real crowd pleaser.\" That means of course it kills a lot of people. <i>Let's Have Fun! </i>was like that. Along the lines of the Chinese <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times\">curse</a> -- May you live in interesting times. Our culture was that we enjoyed our work, even when it felt like a death march. ;-)</li><li>One more software slogan, when someone reports a bug, a bad one, think to yourself &nbsp;\"It's even worse than it appears.\" That'll give you something to laugh about while you're investigating.&nbsp;</li></ol><p></p>",

They have decided that if you want to continue to publish to users, you must comply with the new regulation established by Mozilla. If not, we'll mark you as unsafe, and make sure everyone knows you're not to be trusted. And this is just the current iteration. When that fails to </span><a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=6454330\">alter</a><span> user behavior, or cause sites to convert, what next? Will they stop displaying them altogether? As Google does when they encounter a site that it thinks has malware embedded?&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>At the same time, Mozilla is most definitely not a government. They are a private company. And they have not disclosed the impact of shutting down access to a huge part of the web. I likened it to </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning\">book burning</a><span> but on an unprecedented scale. As a user of the web, both as a publisher and a reader, I want protection from this kind of power grab. The web does not belong to Mozilla. What if it works? Most of my own sites will disappear, and lots of sites that I care about.</span></li></ol><p></p><p>I wonder if they've even tried to quantify the outages they'll cause. So many sites are simply residing on a hard disk somewhere, served by an ancient version of some unknown and not maintained server software, chugging along as someone keeps paying the electric bill, and replaces a broken hardware component when needed. The people who created the site might not have understood HTTPS or how to deploy it, and many are long gone. Some of course are dead. We are certainly not all sitting around doing nothing waiting for a handful of programmers on a mail list to make us perform a ridiculous act of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/18/0667.html\">security theater</a> for our blog posts written in 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of these sites do not need HTTPS. It isn't an issue for my ancient blog posts. Or yours.</p><p>In the thread there are some very reasonable alternatives offered, that help Mozilla achieve their goal, without burning all those sites. For example, if the browser sees a form that contains a password or a credit card number being transmitted over a non-encrypted connection it could warn you with a big dialog box, saying hey dummy, your ISP or their ISP can read that stuff. Are you sure you want to send it? That would actually communicate clearly to the user what the issue is without the confusion at the point where security matters.&nbsp;</p><p>It was also pointed out that some users are going to think the browser is broken. Smart users! They are right. The browser <i>is</i> broken. It has totally the wrong idea of its role.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine Honda or Ford tried to do something like this. It noticed you were stopping at a McDonald's. Your Civic stops and a big red X shows up in your dashboard. When you ask why it says \"McDonald's is not good for you Davey. Go somewhere healthy like Panera or Whole Foods.\" You might say who the fuck is Honda to tell me where to get my comfort food? And you would be right. Only in tech would they be so arrogant as to think they know better, when (get this) -- they don't.</p><p>If we had government oversight, they might require the equivalent of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_statement\">Environmental Impact Statement</a>. How many sites will disappear as a result of what you're doing? Maybe require them to disclose that so their users have a chance to switch to a browser that is less opinionated.</p><p>The web isn't their property. They are just providing a tool. They have too much power if this goes through. I suspect once they start putting red X's on sites that people care about, and their support people start handling calls saying the browser is broken, they might put this back on the list, as an urgent bug, and find a nicer way to help users stay safe, one that doesn't require sacrificing large pieces of the web.&nbsp;</p>",

Carter is an honest man, exceptionally so, in hindsight. But not a great President.</p><p>We elected Reagan to fix the bug with Carter. Reagan promised to make us feel good about ourselves after Carter talked about our \"national malaise.\" No President since has tried that one. Not a good idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Then Bush was milquetoast to Reagan's charisma. We had had enough of charm. Time for a guy whose mind while basically sound (imho) was at war with the English language.&nbsp;</p><p>Clinton was charisma because we were bored with Bush and because we didn't really want Perot.</p><p>And on and on.</p><p>Obama? We desperately needed hope after Bush II destroyed the economy. I laugh when the Repubs talk about the \"disaster that is Obama.\" I guess they expect us to have short memories. And we do, collectively, have very short memories.</p><p>Now here's why certain people like Trump.&nbsp;</p><p>To them Obama is a disaster simply because of the color of his skin. They like to say they're not racists, but deep inside there's a feeling something is wrong here. We need to get America \"back on track.\" Which means a Strong White Male in charge. And Trump plays the role of a strong confident White Male to a T.&nbsp;</p><p>That's my theory for why Trump is doing well.</p>",

Everyone talks about how great Sanders is and how HRC is okay, but actually she's just the right person to follow Obama imho.&nbsp;</p><p>The world is scared of us, but not in a good way. They're not scared because they're all bad guys and we're the good guys, they're scared because we're acting crazy, have been for quite a while, and it's getting worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure the President should inspire us, but more important imho the President should be a good representative for us internationally. As crazy as Congress is, if we elect HRC, the rest of the world can relax a little, because the lunacy quotient has steadied a bit. We still have all the crazyness in Congress, but after the election the Republicans are going through, they might just calm down a little if we avoid Trump or Cruz as President. Either of them would change the Republican Party so much as to make it unrecognizable. And probably not in a good way if you're hoping for a return to sanity, as I am.</p><p>So it's not like I'd love to have Bernie but I'm settling for Hillary. I view this as a baseball manager trying to decide who should bat next. Should we send in someone who might walk or get a hit, but probably isn't going to strike out, but won't hit a home run either? Or should I put in someone who will swing for the fences knowing there's a very high probability they'll strike out.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2008 we needed the latter. We needed a miracle, and we got one. But 2016 is not 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, we need a solid hitter, someone who the rest of the world is comfortable with, and who a deeply injured Republican Party can work with. The US has been a bronco the last decade or two, starting wars, leading to huge instability around the world and taken unnecessary risks with the world economy. Real recklessness.&nbsp;</p><p>Time to sober up, everyone. Or else.</p><p>No I don't think it would be lunacy to elect Sanders, but I do think it would be lunacy to elect Trump. I believe HRC is as honest as any politician, including Sanders who imho is selling some real snake oil. And her honesty isn't the issue exactly. The issue is what kind of world do we want and what do we want our role in it to be.</p>",

Reliable. With an API. That's what I was <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html\">looking for</a>. And guess what, it's 2016 and Twitter has it working. And 300 million people use it, &nbsp;it scales.</p><p>But they've limited the potential applications of this resource, only to allow it to run through software that they design so they can create a not so profitable ad business on it.&nbsp;</p><p>But it seemed to me then and now that it could be much more than that.</p><p>I look at Twitter as a 1. User. 2. Developer. 3. Shareholder.&nbsp;</p><p></p><ol><li><span>As a user I miss that <i>Living In The Future</i> feeling I used to get with Twitter.</span></li><li><span>As a developer, I think they're within easy grasp of it, by just sharing the ability to create for this platform with developers who don't work for Twitter.</span></li><li><span>As a shareholder, I understand there's risk in this. It means Facebook can run software against Twitter's cloud. And so can developers who grow huge, remembering Instagram as an example. But, Twitter can also become a banker and distributor for these projects. That's what mature platform vendors always do. They don't try to force all the creativity through their own developer organization.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p></p><p>It's like that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jpwqWPKAUc\">scene</a> in The Godfather where the families sit down with Don Corleone and insist that he share his senators and judges, for a fee of course. This is where we have that talk with Twitter. It's time to share the platform and we'll help you grow it. And we should become friends so you don't feel good about crushing us and we trust you so we'll continue to invest in the platform. This <i>can</i> be done, if you're human about it.&nbsp;</p><p>For specifics see a post I wrote in August last year,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/08/31/twitterNt.html\">Twitter NT</a>.&nbsp;</p>",
