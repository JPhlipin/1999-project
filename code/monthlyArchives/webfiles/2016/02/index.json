I'm probably one of about a thousand people left who remember it. He would write open letters to tech CEOs. It was one of my inspirations for blogging, when I started in 1994. He's a good writer, and his experiences with products are worth listening to, even if sometimes they were totally off the wall. ;-)</p><p>There are good tech companies around who will use that kind of feedback, soak it up, ask for more and possibly use it to guide their product decisions. At its peak, Microsoft was like this. Their CEO, the famous Bill Gates, set the tone for the company. He was very curious sometimes in kind of an angry way, but you definitely knew he was listening. Same with Jeff Bezos at Amazon. There are counter-examples. I could see Steve Jobs banning someone as a user if he didn't like their attitude. On the other hand, I had a big complaint about Apple while he was running the company in 2007, and they responded really well even though I was <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/22/macsAreEvenMoreExpensiveTh.html\">blogging publicly</a> about it.&nbsp;</p><p>I think Musk and Tesla owe Alsop: 1. An apology. 2. The car he paid for (obviously). 3. Some kind of gift to show they understand that their job is to <i>please</i> people like Stewart, not ban them. Ridiculous that this is the kind of culture people tolerate in tech these days. Fix this, OK?</p><p>PS: I don't own a car at all so I'm not worried about being banned by Tesla, but I hear they're pretty cool, and overall I like the way Musk leads.&nbsp;</p>",

This almost certainly was a leak-from-the-top, given that it happened on a Friday night, long after the market closed.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Update: Jack <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/696081566032723968\">says</a> it ain't so!</i></p><p>Yes, it would be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sacca/status/695990402038394880\">suicide</a> for Twitter to change the timeline for existing users. What they probably will do is offer a setting. Do you want the classic timeline or the new SMART timeline?</p><p>For existing users it will default off. We get the same timeline as before, the <i>While You Were Out</i> feature notwithstanding (an example of when they changed the timeline quietly without any fanfare without an opt-in or out).&nbsp;</p><p>For new users, and existing users who haven't logged in recently, or don't follow many people, it will default on.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't think it's terrible or the end of the world. Life in a silo where you and I are the product. McDonald's doesn't ask the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154047699301162&amp;set=a.10152193121576162.1073741826.501596161&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">chickens</a> whether they like the <a href=\"http://hackthemenu.com/mcdonalds/secret-menu/mcnugget-dipping-sauces/\">options</a> for <a href=\"http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/your_questions/our_food/chicken-and-fish.html\">Chicken McNuggets</a>. A similar thing. The main difference is the chicken probably couldn't say. Humans have opinions, feel disempowered, not heard, not loved, bored, and we like to be <a href=\"http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html\">consulted</a>. A good <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RIPTwitter?src=tren\">shitstorm</a> provides temporary relief for all these ills. So for a while, venting, then life goes back to the normal humdrum.&nbsp;</p><p>But!</p><p>Would it hurt Twitter to add some features for users? Ones that just make us feel cared-for and whose loyalty is valued? Long-standing lackings in the product, addressed, finally? (I'm trying to talk like Sarah Palin, howamidoing?)</p><p></p><ol><li>I for one would love to have the ability to delete a message in my Notifications panel. Someone leaves a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/06/whyYouGotBlocked.html#4IThinkOfThemAsTurds\">turd</a>. I'd just like to delete it, so I don't have to see it repeatedly. It's really time for this little feature. It can't be that hard to add.</li><li><span>How about unfollow-with-timeout? I'd like to unfollow someone for a few days, or a week or two, maybe. They're live-tweeting a conference I don't care about. Why should they feel compelled not to do it, and why should I have to endure the chatter. If I could unfollow them knowing they would return to my timeline eventually, I could keep them as a source, and not have to put up with the barrage of (to me) nonsense.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>And btw, the Mute command is great but it often doesn't work. And it would be nice if it were retroactive.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p></p><p>I guess the point is this. Twitter seems to only do new features that try to dig them out of their business hole. I don't mind if they do that. I am a shareholder, after all. But since they have a monopoly on Twitter services, it would be nice if they also added features for the users. They shouldn't assume we will always be without a choice. It's a good thing to do for your product and company, to keep the users/product happy.&nbsp;</p>",

I find that very very offensive. Not just on her behalf but on behalf of our country, half of which are women, and none of which have ever been President. Think about that for a minute. Maybe the difference in respect has something to do with that.</p><p>She is a serious candidate, no matter what you think of her politics. She deserves not just equal consideration, but a little extra to compensate, because it's clear not everyone is on board with the idea that we can have a woman as leader. </p><p>I also think we can forgive Gloria Steinem and Madeline Albright, two pioneers in this cause, for making the case awkwardly. What they were trying to say, imho is that one of the reasons to vote for HRC is that she is a woman and the other candidates are not. This is an extra value available to our country. We should grab it because the opportunity might not come up again any time soon. Maybe what's offensive about the idea is that Albright said women should vote for HRC because she's a woman and a better idea is that we <i>all</i> should vote for a woman because it would be good for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only can we have a competent leader, but we can also break another barrier.

        "text": "<p>Good morning!</p><p>Today's a good day to ship <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5\">something new</a>!</p><p>As you may know, I've been involved in <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS</a>\n as a standard way to distribute news since the beginning. I wrote the RSS 0.91 and RSS 2.0 specs, and shipped the first software that was compatible with both formats. My early products, My.UserLand and Radio UserLand got the market started, along with a deal we did with the NY Times in 2002 to get their news flowing on the RSS net.</p><p>The RSS market is slowly rebuilding after the dominance of Google Reader was followed by its closing a couple of years ago. It shows how resilient open formats and protocols are. If Google Reader had been built on proprietary formats, that would have been the end. But RSS isn't something anyone can own, an idea that confuses many big companies.&nbsp;</p><p>RSS is alive and kicking and ready to act as the open distribution format for news for many years to come.</p><p><b>RSS and JavaScript</b></p><p>I switched over to development in JavaScript a few years ago, and one of the first things I did when I got to Node.js was build an RSS aggregator, River4. I built it to run on Heroku, which I thought was a revolutionary platform, because of its pricing and architecture. It was designed for lots of little apps that are easily deployed. I love that idea, it's one of the foundations that my own environment, Frontier, was based on. River4 was a good fit for Heroku, but that made it awkward to deploy elsewhere. Over time we took care of that, but that made it more complicated to configure. And Heroku changed their economics, and that made it less attractive. I started running my rivers on straight Linux.</p><p>I also learned about various ways to configure Node apps as I understood more about Node, and that is also reflected in the design of River4, not in a good way. There are some things that can only be configured in environment variables, and others that can only be configured through a config.json file. It became a bit of a hairball.</p><p><b>A new foundation</b></p><p>So I decided it was time to do a restart of my JavaScript RSS aggregator, and it's now ready for Node users -- it's called <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5\">River5</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul><li>It's <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5\">open source</a>, MIT License.&nbsp;</li><li>There's a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/river5\">mail list</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5#examples-of-working-rivers\">Example sites</a>.</li><li>A <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/87903653a0f5f6df13b4\">Hello World</a> app.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5/blob/master/docs/ROADTORIVER5.md\">The Road to River5</a>, for the historically-minded.</li></ul><p>This ia a foundation for developers to build on, but it's also possible for an adventurous user to set up their own rivers. Ken Smith, an English professor, is running River5 on his personal computer. It works. I wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5/blob/master/docs/FORPOETS.md\">Poets Guide</a> for people who are new to Node.</p><p><b>What's new?</b></p><p>So what's new in this river?</p><p></p><ul><li><span>It's faster since it builds the rivers incrementally as it scans the feeds. There's no intermediate database.&nbsp;</span></li><li>Configuration is simple, consistent and <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5/blob/master/docs/CONFIG.md\">documented</a>. You just edit a config.json file in the same folder as the application.</li><li><span>In addition to the standard list format, I've also defined a JSON format for lists and a plain text format, to make it easier for people to get going.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Most important to me, it's easier for me to work on, so there's a better chance of new features in the future.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><span><b>Thanks!</b></span><p></p><p><span>I love RSS and the developers who support it. I also love JavaScript and Node, and think the two were made for each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Let a thousand rivers bloom! ;-)</span></p>",

That's what Sanders says, more or less, but not clearly enough. Nothing about what he proposes to do, as vague as it is, has a prayer if people aren't willing to go to rallies and march and strike to make it happen. I assume he glosses this over because we're in the magic and unicorns phase of the campaign. If he were too clear about it, people might get bored or scared, or stop believing. A lot of minds have to change before you can have the kind of change he's talking about.&nbsp;</p><p>I've seen this movie, as I think you can tell. I even signed on to working after the election, but each time when the moment came for us to participate in government, it just reverted to the way it worked before. And no, I don't believe this time is different. Not until I see people reorienting their lives to become politically active beyond the election, and equally important, the candidates explain exactly how that's going to work, and it has to sound like it has a chance.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not to say that I've given up, we have huge problems to deal with, beyond income inequality. I wish we were talking about the kind of change that would give our climate a chance. If that's what Sanders was selling, I'd be much more enthusiastic. Somehow climate change isn't any candidate's talking point. That shows something is seriously wrong with our political system, and what's wrong includes Sanders and his supporters.&nbsp;</p>",

I would gladly pay $100 year for this privilege, but not only does the Times not have an offering in that range, but they also do this \"nickel and diming\" thing where they charge one price for Web + smartphone, a different price for Web + tablet, and then if you want Web + smartphone + tablet, they add the two together. This just irks me, and causes me to spurn both. I truly believe that the Times is leaving a lot of money on the table. Oh well…</p>",

This..</p><p>On <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/415911168616294?comment_id=416044475269630&amp;reply_comment_id=416050041935740&amp;notif_t=feed_comment_reply\">Facebook</a>, in a partisan political \"debate,\" drive-by trollers repeat insults that were posted literally two messages above them in the thread! Now that's some efficient mindless trolling. ;-)</p><p><b>Follow-up</b></p><p>I heard from one of the people who gave me an answer that ignored the question I asked. He didn't like this post. Well this is a real blog, and a real person works here, not a TV character. When I get an answer, I share the result, in the form of clean tested sample code that's documented. That's what I love to find.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, when I ask a question like the one I asked, it's not just for me that I ask it. I found a missing piece of example code. If anyone else wants to make a client call from a server using WebSockets (and not some other protocol) there will now be that code, assuming this problem is ever solved (not looking good at the moment).</p><p>So instead of having your feelings hurt, why don't you dive in, and figure the problem out and help. You're not just helping me (as stated above, because I know you're probably skimming) you're helping the web and other programmers.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for listening. (If you actually did.)</p>",

It was over 300MB. So then the question was what to do with it.&nbsp;</p><p>There was nothing especially confidential in the video, so I uploaded it to YouTube, but as usual for software demos, YouTube's resolution is way too low. I'm not enough of a video expert to know how to fix that. I tried uploading it <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/videos/vb.100005922431565/416072185266859/?type=2&amp;theater\">to Facebook</a>, maybe they'd do a better job? They did. Much nicer.</p><p>About the demo. I did some work late last year to embed River4 in an Electron shell. In the process I fell in love with Electron. It's very rational technology. Node and Chrome baked into a desktop environment, with access to all local resources.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end I wasn't sure I had come up with something that was easier, so instead I focused on simplifying the engine, and the result was <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/09/0995.html\">River5</a>. I may at sometime swing back around to this project, or use the Electron knowledge I've gained in something else.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway if you watch <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/videos/vb.100005922431565/416072185266859/?type=2&amp;theater\">the video</a>, hope you find it interesting. ;-)</p>",

They were good people. I think history has borne that out. But they were flawed candidates, and Carter was a President who achieved none of his promise, which btw, sounded an awful lot like what Sanders is promising. These guys hit brick walls. You can't wish the wall away. it's there whether you want to see it or not.</p><p>Obama would have been a more effective President if, on arriving in DC, he assumed the Republicans would be exactly as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-A09a_gHJc\">obstructionist</a> as they said they'd be. I'm pretty sure the recovery would have been stronger if he had done so, and our health insurance would be better.

And trying to understand what it is people see in him.</p><p>One of the first questions they asked is if he is a single-issue candidate as HRC says he is. He answered a different question, explaining what a jerk HRC is for saying he's a single-issue candidate, and how he's running a clean race. Heh. And then he talks at length about his single issue. So yes, he is a single-issue candidate, and when you call him on it he gets nasty.</p><p>It's a consistent pattern. 1. Bernie, is this true? 2. They're members of the Establishment so of course you'd expect them to say that. 3. But Bernie is it true? 4. They're members of the Establishment.&nbsp;</p><p>Then one of the citizens of the town hall asks him what he's going to do about the tough lives black and Hispanic people have, esp men who are incarcerated at much higher rates than whites, with the caveat that we've heard all about how you're going to address the problem by getting them better jobs, and could you say something other than that, because not all of the problems are economic, some of them involve prejudice. So Bernie proceeds to explain how he's going to get them better jobs and that should solve the problem. He says it a bunch of different ways, filling up a lot of time, but he's repeating the same idea over and over, if you actually listen to the words he's saying.</p><p>I watched for another fifteen minutes as he did it over and over. Clearly they've thought it through and decided that he must not talk about anything other than this because he's a single-issue candidate and doesn't know enough about anything else to speak coherently about it.</p>",

That was a good email, because it proved that the then-nascent art of blogging could be two-way. Gates was at the pinnacle of power in the tech industry at the time, as the web moved into the desktop. He was at the start of one of the biggest pivots in history, and this exchange was totally on-topic with that. (And some of the questions he asked have since been answered, for example, yes the web meant the end of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta\">Encarta</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>Then I thought of an email I got from <a href=\"http://scripting.com/98/04/stories/bobAtkinsonOnHttpPost.html\">Bob Atkinson</a>, also of Microsoft, in the winter of 1998. I had just written a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html\">piece</a> about how to do networking protocols using the web. It had occurred to me in what I call a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/08/26/mindBombsForY2k.html\">mind bomb</a>, a flash of insight, that XML-over-HTTP could replace the deeply complicated and history-laden networking protocols of the Mac and PC, which were totally incompatible with each other. Using the web for program-to-program communication would turn out to be a breakthrough in simplicity and today whole industries are based on the idea.</p><p>Anyway, I don't have a copy of Bob's email but it went something like this.</p><blockquote>\"We want to do this too. Would you like to work with us?\"</blockquote><p>The next week I was in Redmond in a big room with a bunch of Microsoft people, designing what would turn out to be <a href=\"http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html\">XML-RPC</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

That's blogging at its best, imho.&nbsp;</p><h4>Where to go?</h4><p>In one of the follow-up emails I listed three things we could do to help the open web reboot.

Here's a quote.</p><blockquote>Basically the idea is that we’ll have a core that’s project-based learning, but where students can have a really deep, integrative longer-term project rather than shorter projects. And then all of the knowledge acquisition would be moved virtually. So instead of projects' being at the periphery, to sort of flip it more toward the graduate-education model. And I think it would be much more inspirational for the students because they could come in and really work on projects from the get-go that they wanted to work on and that they were most passionate about, and they could tailor their knowledge base to the projects they want to work on.</blockquote><p>This is exactly the idea I've been <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+university+open+source&amp;oq=site%3Ascr&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i58j69i59l3.2359j1j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8\">promoting</a> about having students work on an open source project while at university. Some would go on to get jobs in companies that are using the technology. Some will start new ventures around the technology. And when they need a break, they can come back to school, teach, share what they've learned, and do some projects with other people, just for the fun of it.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea is to get beyond student projects, to use the university environment to do development. All aspects of it. Documentation, training, support, QA, interop with other projects, creating new standards. We know so much about these things now, we shouild be doing more than teaching it, we should be practicing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Our experience with the bootstrap of podcasting and political blogging at Berkman in the early part of the last decade were models.

Links go to other places on the open web. So finally when we write stuff that's posted to Facebook our writing can be part of the web.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>When you update a post after it appears on Facebook, they get the updates, so you don't have to do anything to keep it in sync.</span></li><li>It's built on <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS</a>, an open format. The RSS can be used for other purposes, such as posting to LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium or any <i>new service</i> that might come along. So Facebook doesn't have an exclusive on this flow. They are not being a silo! Hey how about that.</li><li><span>Because Facebook is the largest source of flow, it seems the others will have to match them. The easiest way to match them is to just accept the same feed I use to post to Facebook.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>I can and will modify <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5\">River5</a>\n to support the Instant Article format. All kinds of new services can boot up on the flow, without depending on Facebook servers. You can't be turned off by Facebook. This is the key feature of the open web, it's the platform without a platform vendor.</span></li><li><span>My blog shares in this flow. So now I don't have to neglect my blog in order to post to Facebook. I can have both, with the same effort. That means I control my archive, and should the terms of service change radically, my writing will still exist, outside the silo.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Your blogging platform, WordPress, Tumblr, Drupal, etc will almost certainly support this format in addition to the current feed it produces. Or these features could be rolled into the existing feed. Either approach will work. So you can expect, if you are a blogger, that you will not have to do anything but update your software (if you host it yourself) to get the new connection to Facebook. I'm sure they're all working on getting ready for the April rollout.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p></p><p>Summary: Facebook is using open web technology to power Instant Articles. I'm not sharing anything that isn't already publicly documented on the Facebook developer site. People have trouble understanding this, I assume, because it seems so out of character for a big web destination like Facebook to care about the open web. It's kind of a miracle. But there it is. The open web is about to get a real shot in the arm from a most unexpected place.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: I have been in the loop on this for almost two years. But until I was able to produce a feed that correctly flows through their system, it was all speculation. But it's no longer speculative. I've tried it, it works as advertised.&nbsp;</p>",

So I went looking for the article in my timeline. It wasn't there. Then I opened the Pages app on my iPhone, and it was there. So there's no doubt that the article had been picked up by the operating system on the \"other side.\"</p><p>Why wasn't it in the timeline?</p><p>Then I had an idea. I posted a link to the version of the article on <a href=\"http://scripting.com\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://scripting.com\">scripting.com</span></a>&nbsp;to my timeline on Facebook. It shows up with the usual title and snippet in a box, linked to the original. But then, when I looked at it on my iPhone, and clicked the link, up popped the Instant Articles version of the piece.</p><p>Conclusion: The Instant Articles scanner creates an association in the Facebook database betw the URL of a story on my site, and the Instant rendering of the story. If you're looking at it in the timeline on the phone and you click the link, you see the instant version.

It starts by building a movement of committed revolutionaries who are willing to give up something substantial, over a long period of time, for the revolution.</p><p>Showing up to vote is not much of a commitment. Marching on Washington with a few hundred thousand others, now that's a beginning. And even then you probably don't get the revolution. You have to convince not just people like me who passionately believe in open health care and education, investing in our young people, creating opportunity for everyone, really dealing with climate change, you also have to convince a fair number of people who are voting for Trump. And that means doing a lot of talking <i>and listening, </i>and that's going to take years. We as a country are very far away from the place we need to be to get the kind of change we want to see.</p><p>And btw, they'd like to have a talk with you, about things <i>they</i> care about. &nbsp;</p><p>So maybe before you just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardAngwin/status/702613854816174080\">leave the room</a> you might want to have a discussion about what it will take to convince your fellow citizens that you have what it take to create a revolution.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding #feeltheburn to your tweets is not enough. &nbsp;</p><p>PS: Thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGLGzRXY5Bw\">Beatles</a> for the title of this post and the first line.&nbsp;</p>",

Also known as sources.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Some numbers perhaps from pollsters or researchers.</span></li><li><span>A closing paragraph (optional, the Times often omits them, which makes a lot of sense).</span></li></ol><p></p><p>Now for ten points, tell me which of these items has changed the most in the last few decades. It's #3 of course.&nbsp;</p><h4>Sources go direct</h4><p>The big revolution brought to us by the Internet is that sources can now speak publicly, easily and for free, using Twitter and blogs mostly. I once predicted that every member of the US House of Representatives would be a blogger. That seemed bold at the time, but today? It's much bigger than that. The President of the United States just wrote a guest <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/a-responsibility-i-take-seriously/\">post</a> on the SCOTUS blog. Think about all the change that represents.</p><p>For me, this ability to go direct, was the reason I started blogging. In 1994 I had a Mac product. Couldn't get the news out because reporters, even though they all used Macs, believed the Mac was dead. They reported their belief, not facts.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of people used Macs, and there was lots of new software. There was no way to get news of new products out to users, because it contradicted the belief that there were no new products. So I started communicating directly, using the web, and it worked. We got enough users for our software to allow it to evolve into blogging, podcasting, RSS.&nbsp;</p><p>Markets could develop without the support of journalism. That's a big new thing and should have been a wakeup call for the news industry, if they weren't mostly ignoring blogs or trivializing them.&nbsp;</p><p>So now when a reporter needs quotes, he or she may turn to Twitter, or a blog, or search, to find the sources they need. The phone, the previous technology used for gaining quotes, is not used as much these days.</p><h4>The missed opportunity that amazingly still is open</h4><p><span>At the same time the news organizations have missed a chance to embrace this phenomenon by working on new tools to help their sources communicate more effectively. They've let the tech industry own it, and it hasn't imho done a very good job. It's all very confusing in user-publishing land. I imagine that reporters at the big pubs think this is okay, but it's not. Their business models are disintegrating, ad blockers are a user revolution, a sign that things may be about to collapse quickly from here. I was on the receiving end of a user revolution in the late 80s as the CEO of a software publisher that practiced copy protection. One month it was something users grumbled about, and the next month we were all rushing to release versions of our product without it.</span></p><p>There's a lot of garbage blogging and tweeting going on out there. Only a relatively few people do a great job of it and strive to do better. These people should be part of the news ecosystems that news orgs gather around themselves. Not replacing reporters, not replacing anything. The bloggers are the sources, with the ability to publish on their own.</p><p>Bottom-line: The most interesting sources of the NY Times should be offered a chance to blog at a <a href=\"http://nytimes.com\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://nytimes.com\">nytimes.com</span></a>&nbsp;domain. One that's clearly seen as the user community of the NYT, so it's understood that the quality of the writing is not something that's subject to the NYT standards. But at the same time, let new standards evolve, and nurture them. Take an interest in the bloggers.&nbsp;</p><p>The Times has yet to really make a serious attempt to understand what blogging is. For years they called their reporters who write using blogging software bloggers. That was a big disconnect. The bloggers are your current sources and future sources. You have to call some of them on the phone but mostly you read their tweets and blogs.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a vacuum that has existed from the beginning. Why not fill it? Take a chance. Experiment with the new technology in meaningful and potentially revolutionary ways. What exactly do you have to lose?</p>",

Which is very cool!</blockquote><p>That's exactly right. The feed is how stuff enters their content system. But the feed itself is outside, leaving it available for other services to use. It's great when this happens, rather than doing it via a WG that tend to go on for years, and create stuff that's super-complicated, why not design something that works for you, put it out there with no restrictions and let whatever's going to happen happen. That's certainly how I've done my past projects. I like to create functionality much more than I like to go back and forth on mail lists.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Now to answer your question, I don’t know very much about AMP.</span></p><p>The reason I was able to get on board with IA is that one of the directors at Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/douglas-purdy#/entity\">Doug Purdy</a>, wanted to work with me. So we met almost two years ago, here in NYC. Then I was briefed on what they were doing, and kept in the loop as it came together. In the beginning all I had was a promise that it would be <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS</a>\n. I’ve seen many companies over the years say nice things about being open, but somehow forget as the project goes forward.</p><p>But they came through. When I got to start work on it early last week, it turned out they had stuck to the promise. It was a simple addition to my RSS-generating code to have it also generate an IA feed. It took three sessions over three days to do the work, and to ship.</p><p>So that’s pretty good use of existing technology as I see it.&nbsp;;-)</p><p>About AMP, no one ever sent me an intro to what they were doing. They emphasized the big companies they were working with. To be fair, so did Facebook. From my point of view it’s largely because Doug really wanted this openness that it happened. I find that many of the big open innovations over the years have one person inside a big company who sees it as worth the extra effort to do something open.&nbsp;</p><p>Basically I find that developers <i>want</i> to create open stuff, it's part of the ethos of programming. So sometimes it actually happens. ;-)</p><p>PS: On Twitter, Tom Murphy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_murphy/status/703625196209631232\">called</a> this a \"bridge into a walled garden.\" Beautiful.</p><p>PPS: On Facebook, Purdy <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/419005314973546?comment_id=419019898305421&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R0%22%7D&amp;pnref=story\">lists</a> the people who worked on the open protocol at FB.</p>",
