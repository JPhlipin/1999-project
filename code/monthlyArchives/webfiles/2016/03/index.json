Thanks.</p><p>The Occam's Razor conclusion is not that it's a gaffe, instead that it's real. Trump is himself a white supremacist. He sure talks and acts like one.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there's a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2016/03/donald-trump-super-tuesday-push-violence-black-woman\">video</a> of some white men at a Trump rally, one dressed as a veteran, physically abusing a young black woman. It's shocking.&nbsp;</p><p>Someone said the Republican response to the Obama presidency has been a slow-motion lynching. I had the same thought but didn't dare say it. Now it's time to say it. Past time. Trump is what the Repubs, some of whom are decent people, were flirting with, as a way to win elections.&nbsp;</p><p>Do we have any recourse against a candidate running this kind of campaign? No one has gotten killed yet, let's start thinking about that before it happens. Watching the Secret Service act at his command seems very wrong. They work for us, not him. They work for the protestors too.&nbsp;</p><p>BTW, the discourse on the Democratic side hasn't caught up with reality yet. Even Marco Rubio, who has been fairly brave at stating what's obvious, still hasn't had the nerve to say what it is we're actually seeing.&nbsp;</p><p>They were laughing a lot last night on MSNBC. I watched Fox for a while, they were trying to carry on as if this would settle down to something acceptable. But our understanding of these disgraceful and un-American acts, crimes actually, hasn't yet caught up to reality. We need to get <i>ahead</i> of it. We might want to pass some laws about what we're seeing. This might be something both Repubs and Dems agree to.</p><p>If you think Trump is inevitably going to be President, remember that he isn't yet President and won't be for a while. We still have some time to prevent the worst of what may be about to happen.</p><p>PS: Here's a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/703996959544250373\">link</a> to Trump's supposed disavowal. It isn't of course that. I think he's a white supremacist. Racist, neo-Nazi. That's the presumptive Republican nominee for President.&nbsp;</p>",

If you guys were serious about backing away from Trump, you all would admit you made a (serious) mistake in all the many ways you all try to invalidate the President that the <i>people of the United States</i> elected. Don't you see this is the problem! We elect someone, twice, and you all pretend he didn't get elected? Well who the fuck are you? As Trump says, you're the guy who lost. And your party acts like you won.&nbsp;</p><p>So let's get going with the Scalia court replacement. Until you all are ready to play the proper role as established by the Constitution, then you aren't serious.&nbsp;</p><p>Stop coming up with things for other people to do, and start doing what you yourselves can do.</p><p>Another -- have the Republican Party go on record saying that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/selenalarson/status/706141110964367360\">climate change</a> is real, and we are going to stop obstructing efforts to change the American economy to take that into account.&nbsp;</p><p>And another thing -- the NRA. They clearly aren't going to get you elected this year. Sure the 2nd Amendment is deeply etched in the brains of the voters. So we aren't going to change anything there. But the NRA isn't bounded by the 2nd Amendment. They make you guys do a lot of other nasty things. Send them packing. Let them scream. Just say loud and clear you're kicking out one of the biggest sources of obstruction.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's start getting rid of the maggots and parasites.</p><p>One more thing -- call off all your voter suppression. It's another of the many awful and amazing things you guys do out in the open for all to see. You've tried to make some people's votes count and others not. That's not your place. That's like stealing. Something you should go to jail for.&nbsp;</p><p>Romney was a perfect choice. A VC money-mover. Doesn't create anything, doesn't even do anything other than say shit to get people riled up. The problem is Mitt, it isn't working anymore. Now what are you going to do?&nbsp;</p><p>PS: Here's a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPmYZn-OsNk\">video</a> of Romney's snotty RNC 2012 bit about climate change.&nbsp;</p>",

It's amazing it took so long for us to get here. Just flip Reality TV over, and take it out of the realm of fantasy. On this island, the last survivor gets to live in the White House and fly around on Air Force One. Politics has changed forever, probably not just here in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>Colbert was prophetic. Trump is doing the same thing, but he got off the for-play stage and jumped onto the for-real stage. Basically no difference. Remember when McCain said Obama was a celebrity? He was figuring it out.

He was at home, in his element, his support network all around him. And guess what Bernie is a mensch! I thought maybe I had unfairly judged him. He seems like a nice guy.</p><p>Until then my main exposure to Sanders was on the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/us/politics/democratic-debate-highlights.html\">debate stage</a> with his adversary standing next to him. And last night, I was reminded why I think Bernie is such a bad choice to lead anything. He may have been a good mayor of Burlington, you can see that, given how the people there envelope him in love. But when challenged, as a President surely is, Bernie becomes a defensive raging jerk. It makes me so uncomfortable, I want to do something.&nbsp;</p><p>If I were sitting in the audience at a conference with two people on stage and Bernie lecturing everyone, including his adversary, I would hopefully get up and walk out. In my weaker moments, in the past, with Larry Ellison or Jason Calacanis for example, I made the mistake of standing up and explaining how they were losing the audience. I'd say the same to Bernie, but I would expect he would paint me as inadequate, a member of The Establishment, who had done business with big banks (I have, as has almost everyone, including Bernie probably, if he ever got a mortgage).&nbsp;</p><p>Bernie gets antagonistic when challenged. In my experience this quality makes someone an awful leader. I would never follow a Sanders type person. Which is kind of ridiculous because I basically agree with him on almost everything. And I'm not running against him. I even surprised myself that I was open to thinking of him as a sweet person. But the Bernie I see on stage in a debate is a person I don't want anything to do with.&nbsp;</p>",

I imagine that with enough work they could probably even put the book together automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>More interesting Google news. They hired <a href=\"http://chrishateswriting.com/post/140641275808/my-next-chapter\">Chris Poole</a>, the founder of 4Chan, to breathe life into Google-Plus community site.

Sometimes very willfully trying to erase my work, when if we worked together, some great results might come of it. For example, what if Google decided to embrace Facebook's IA format.

An epiphany that was available to me at any time, even without therapy. But it took a conversation with my therapist to get me to see it.</p><p>I was talking about a family member, X.</p><p>\"I know exactly what X is thinking right now,\" I said.</p><p>\"Really,\" said the therapist. \"How do you know?\".</p><p>Long pause.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I don't know what X is thinking.\"</p><p>A very simple idea. But so hard to grok. The image I have of someone is different from the person.&nbsp;</p><p>Another example. At a workshop. The teacher passes around a picture of someone famous, Y. He asks each of us, as we hold the picture and look at it, what is that you're holding. Each of us says Y. At the end (you know where this is going, I'm sure) he says we're all wrong. That's not Y. It's a piece of paper that has a picture of Y on it.&nbsp;</p><p>The point -- the image is not the thing. And further, all we see, even when we're close enough to someone to be intimate, is the image. The real thing is only something that X or Y can experience. We can get closer to the piece of paper, but we can't get through the paper to the thing it is representing.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is it important to know this? Maybe it doesn't matter if we understand the difference between image and reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Well it turns out if you want to get along with people, you have to respect the difference. And by respect, I mean acknowledge it, accept the distance between yourself and this other entity. The separation is where each of our power comes from. The unique power to be that thing, whether it's a brother, an actor, even a picture of an actor, all these things deserve our respect, to be taken at face value, not to have their individuality destroyed by treating them as if they were an image of the thing they actually are.&nbsp;</p><p>Kids especially yearn for this kind of respect. And if we don't get it as kids, we carry that through to adulthood. Always seeking recognition, and never getting it. So we slosh around between our bodies, imagining things that aren't real, and never getting closer to intimacy, which is pretty much what we all seek, imho.&nbsp;</p>",

They are swinging, they are really dangerous, and they get in there and they start hitting people.”</blockquote><p>Well, we've actually <a href=\"http://time.com/4255142/donald-trump-protesters-violence-rallies/\">seen</a> the events on video. The protesters are non-violent. Many are women. They aren't bad dudes and they aren't swinging at anyone. The only ones doing violence are Trump supporters. And they're getting more violent all the time. There's no mistaking what's going on.&nbsp;<span>We know what comes next in this sequence of events, and what comes after that and after that and so on.</span></p><p>Janell Ross in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/11/donald-trumps-baffling-explanation-for-violence-at-his-campaign-rallies/\">Washington Post</a> says of Trump's story: \"Language and logic used to justify cross-burnings, lynchings and all manner of illegal, extra-judicial and inhumane behavior in U.S. history. This is what has been said to support attempted genocides, ethnic expulsions and some of the most shameful political acts around the globe. This is the actual route by which bigotry has, in the course of human history, become accepted practice and policy. This is the way that entire groups have been terrorized, demonized and oppressed.\"</p><p>Exactly right.&nbsp;</p><p>So why did the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/03/republican-candidates-let-donald-trump-win.html\">other candidates</a> on stage not take the opportunity to say how wrong it is that Trump rallies are getting more violent, and that Trump is orchestrating it from the stage? The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\">Occam's Razor</a> answer is that they're scared. They figure anyone who can use violence as a way to build a case for order can find a way to silence his adversaries. Remember Trump talks openly about killing family members of our enemies, which is illegal. It's not illegal to threaten your political opponents, as Trump has done from his podium, in front of millions of people. Remember what he said about Paul Ryan.&nbsp;</p><p>People often make the mistake of thinking people couldn't possibly be as bad as they obviously are. Your spouse is staying out all night, and next time you see them they say they were hanging out with friends and it got late. He or she is cheating, although sometimes we don't get that in the moment.</p><p>All the numbers say Trump can't win in the fall, unless something terrible happens. Therefore something terrible is going to happen before the election.&nbsp;<span>A problem that requires a strongman to take power to restore order.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This election will be about whether there are more elections.</p><p>What should be done? Start a citizen's PAC to collect money to run ads now, before Trump wraps up the Repub nomination, being very clear about what's happening, before it has a chance to get much bigger. Later, the ads won't work. It's almost too late now. Trump has to be very clearly positioned as anti-democracy. Let this be an election on whether we want to continue to have elections. It's way beyond Bernie's issue of campaign finance, which is kind of quaint and harkens back to a more innocent time when there was a basic acceptance of laws. Bernie is fighting an old battle. The new one is how to un-lose our minds, and prevent a very dark thing happening to the United States.&nbsp;</p>",

I'm about to become part of a fascist government. Or worse! Be purged by one.</span></p><p>I saw a clip of Lindsey Graham at a recent Judiciary Committee meeting, warning his fellow Republicans that it could be a Democrat in the White House next year, and if so, he's going to vote to ratify his or her nominee, because that's the way it works. There was an incredible quality in his voice, as if things had gotten very real, and he wanted to say the words out loud to be sure he wasn't dreaming. But the substance of his speech gave me encouragement, that it's not all as black and white as it seems on the talk shows. Maybe there's an ability for these people to actually work together. Imho that would be vastly perferrable to having a takeover of the government by Trump. (Graham's speech is at 1:06 in this CSPAN <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?406337-1/senate-judiciary-committee-business-meeting\">video</a>.)</p><p>You have to figure the President is somewhat scared too. Usually when guys like Trump take office they don't like having former leaders around where they can cause trouble. Maybe the Obama Library should be at Gitmo? Maybe that's where we're all headed, in one way or another.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, in the last days of the Republic, I imagine that Obama and McConnell will have a lot to talk about. The only question for both of them is this -- when exactly do the last days start? Seems we're getting pretty close to the edge.&nbsp;</p><p>This feels like a scifi plot about the last days of Earth civilization. A Philip K Dick novel perhaps. And I get a chilling feeling when I see a tweet from Trump saying if he loses Florida he's going to blame \"Little Marco\" for rigging the election. I wonder what Trump would do if he loses. Think he'll just walk away? I kind of doubt it.&nbsp;</p>",

No one is going to go away just because you want them to.</blockquote><p>See also my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/25/1062.html\">earlier post</a> to Sanders fans about their revolution.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>You have to convince not just people like me who passionately believe in open health care and education, investing in our young people, creating opportunity for everyone, really dealing with climate change, you also have to convince a fair number of people who are voting for Trump. And that means doing a lot of talking <i>and listening, </i>and that's going to take years. We as a country are very far away from the place we need to be to get the kind of change we want to see.&nbsp;And btw, they'd like to have a talk with you, about things <i>they</i> care about. &nbsp;</blockquote><p>Our problems are not so specific as America Doesn't Win Anymore or Taxing The Millionaires and Billionaires, the problem is that everyone thinks they're entitled to what they're entitled to, and the rest of you all can go to hell.&nbsp;</p><p>Stewart is in the middle. He's not a Trump voter, and he's not spinning for Bernie. But when he says his problem will \"die off\" I know he isn't listening. No one needs to listen to things that are dying out. Unless they aren't. And they aren't.</p><p>You know who had it right? The great American philosopher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King\">Rodney King</a>.

        "text": "<p>I have a confession to make.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the 80s and 90s I voted Republican.&nbsp;</p><p>I've been trying to figure out why I did that.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 80s I was a software entrepreneur. It was very hard and demanding work. I was doing two full-time jobs, as the CEO of a company during the day, and a programmer at night. The company I wanted to create needed me to do that. I wanted to make exceptional software. So I pulled out all the stops and went for it. That's near as I can explain why the Republican story appealed to me. &nbsp;It's why I was sympathetic to Microsoft until I saw what they tried to do to the Internet. I believed that good engineering practices can lead to good government practices. I've since changed my thinking on that. It's more subtle. Countries have different goals from startups. And necessarily so! I see some of the current generation of tech entrepreneurs struggling with this, as I was thirty years ago.</p><p>I switched to voting for the Dems for the election of 2004. I had seen enough with Bush II. The country was careening in a corrupt way. The Repubs, conservatives, always making a huge issue of deficits, were spending obscenely on two wars. Totally out of control. Without any debate. Being an outspoken critic of the President at that time got you a lot of hate. I was ambivalent about the war <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2003/03/20.html\">here</a> on my blog, as we <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2003/02.html\">were</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2003/03.html\">starting</a> the war. But I was just an individual blogger with an academic job where I was <i>supposed</i> to have public and personal opinions. I remember seeing MSNBC claim the President was a \"Visionary\" when the bombs were first falling on Baghdad. I thought \"we are lost.\" It was in this time that they <a href=\"http://billmoyers.com/2013/03/25/the-day-that-tv-news-died/\">fired Phil Donahue</a> because he was too critical of the President. It's important to remember how we reacted to 9/11. It made us all pretty crazy.&nbsp;</p><p>So I did everything I could to support Kerry. And then Obama twice. And now Clinton. Anything but let the Repubs have control of the whole government. We must remember what kind of country and economy they left us with. All so they could funnel a few more dollars to their friends in the defense industry. That really seems to be what it was all about.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, being a business person comes with very high ethical standards. The dollar chasers who have taken over the Repub Party are a different kind. They act as if as long as they get more dollars anything is justified. They probably were just as bad in the 80s and 90s when I was voting for them, perhaps I was too naive, or busy with my life, to understand.&nbsp;</p><p>I know other Repub voters made a different choice. They vote for bomb throwers, people who think it would have been okay to let the auto industry fail. They should read up about the huge refugee crisis of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl\">Dust Bowl</a>, to get a small idea of the human wreckage that would have created.&nbsp;</p><p>I was having lunch with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kl%C3%B6pping\">Dutch entrepreneur</a> last week, talking about Trump of course, and he said he thought Trump would do or say something that would wake everyone up. That's about the most optimistic thing I've heard! :-)</p>",

A few follow-on notes.</p><p>I have also become a Democratic contributor. I have not only given to Presidential campaigns, but also to local campaigns for candidates that I thought were either inspiring, or in seats that were currently occupied by people I find intolerable. And not just in the areas I live. I've given to candidates all over the US as well as in California and New York where I've lived since switching parties.</p><p>There was another even more important reason I switched. We didn't feel the wars in the US. Our soldiers were dying. We were destroying Iraq, killing many hundreds of thousands of people, turning many more into refugees, but everything went on normally in the US.&nbsp;</p><p><span>You couldn't tell we were at war! Travel all over the world, you'd never know the US was at war. Now that's not sound. When we're fighting a war, esp one that we started (Iraq) we should feel it at home. Our family members should be fighting and dying. Rationing. A lot of us would be involved in the war effort. Taxes would be much higher to pay for the war. Instead, the Repubs just put the wars on the credit card, and controlled what Americans saw on TV. Tax cuts! &nbsp;All our bubbles continued to inflate, the economy over-extended in a very crazy way and it finally crashed in 2008.&nbsp;</span></p><p>People in the US still don't feel responsible, we're so selfish all we think about are what little most of us had to pay. But it was all done in our name, by people we elected. I felt it was paramount in 2004 that we switch from Repubs. Didn't happen until 2008.</p>",

Very good stuff, and much of it is on-topic for the convention fights that are coming up, perhaps in both parties.&nbsp;</p><p>Watching a lot of MSNBC. I find it encouraging that so much of the discourse is now informed and skillful. The people who have had so little to say over the years when there wasn't much news, now have a lot of relevant education and information. Many of them have studied the history of politics. And they know their stuff.</p><p>I wonder if there's a great readable book about how conventions work?</p><p>Trump has hired some inside-Washington political advisors. I saw one of them interviewed on CNN today. BTW, Wolf Blitzer was fantastic with him. Deadpan. No sense of irony. Took all his putdown questions literally (as they deserved to be treated). Even better it's great to hear Trump rep'd by someone who doesn't know how to steamroll a reporter like Trump does. Blitzer was able to control the interview. Refreshing. And the panel that came on after was excellent. None of the usual CNN stuffed shirts who never say anything but the vaguest of platitudes. Intelligence on CNN! Go figure.&nbsp;</p><p>Too much politics on Facebook. Mostly mindless repetitive recitals. I think a lot of other people are feeling the exhaustion. I unfollowed someone today who I know is smart and witty on other things, but is totally tiring me out with his sad and depressing political analysis.

I know they know I must know. So why are they restating the same ideas over and over? Even when I agree with them, I think it's a form of spam. Maybe it gives them a feeling of power? I don't know what to do about this. I don't want to unfriend people because they are exhausting me. I don't want to hide their posts (I don't even know how to do it), and I sure don't want to block them.

Reporters and analysts mainly listen to each other. Trying to get good ideas on the agenda of professional news people, even if they have Twitter accounts and email addresses, is virtually impossible if you aren't one of them or don't use a PR firm to approach them.

They <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/02/29/cbs-donald-trump/\">openly brag</a> that they profit from the destruction of the US political system. I think that's true to some extent of NPR too.&nbsp;</li><li><span>So if we want new politics, we must have new media.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Honestly, I think we have an oversupply of new podcast content, and along with it we have an inadequate discovery system. We need to try out new ideas there. Ones that aren't limited by the limits of radio.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>I'm a blogger, and one of the creators of the podcast medium, and I don't mind promoting new podcasts. You might try broadening your reach to influencers. Right now I get zero new ideas from the industry, I only hear about their podcasts when I ask friends for recommendations.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Be creative, and also listen more.

        "text": "<p>Political discourse on the net is just a minor league version of what you get on cable news. I think that's why it's so exhausting. It's so utterly impersonal. You get cut-and-paste comments from people you've never met, who didn't read what you said, who just gave you a splattering of talking points, presumably to start an argument of some kind, where you recite the talking points of some other guy. We could all just wear badges saying who we're emulating, and click a button to play an MP3 of their talking points. Life on the net could consist of clicking buttons and listening to clips of MP3s. Like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFJeY9fL5tk\">Disco</a> the parakeet. When that's fully implemented the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NFH-OvEWrs\">robots</a> can take over. Sooner than you might think.</p><p>Now I flatter myself to think that I am actually ahead of the talking heads, although these days that can be hard to do because some of the coverage, esp that from Rachel Maddow, is actually pretty first-rate. But I don't see anyone wanting to talk about that stuff on Facebook or elsewhere, people mostly still quote soundbites and talk over each others' heads as if there were massive numbers of people listening. (There aren't.)</p><h4>A question for Sanders</h4><p>If you're a Sanders supporter, I imagine you are one of those people who, like me, is frustrated when we can't get the politicians to budge an inch because they're so totally controlled by the NRA.&nbsp;</p><p>Now since you're a Sanders supporter, and if you're similarly frustrated, can you get a clear statement from your candidate that he agrees or disagrees that when an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\">assault rifle</a> is used to kill people, as it was in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting\">Newtown massacre</a>, that the manufacturer, distributor and retailer that sold the gun should be liable for damages. They don't go to jail, they just compensate the victims.&nbsp;</p><p>The rationale for this is simple. These guns have no practical use for hunting. Their only purpose is killing large numbers of humans. They have use in wars, but no real use for civilians, unless they want to kill lots of other humans.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sanders-is-wrong-about-the-lawsuit-we-filed-after-our-son-was-murdered-in-newtown/2016/03/18/d5892e2a-ebbb-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html\">op-ed</a> written by parents who lost their 7-year-old son in Newtown, explaining why Sanders' dismissal of their lawsuit was wrong. You really have to read this to understand the issue and why Sanders is so wrong about it.</p><p>So here's the question for Sanders.</p><p>Senator Sanders, please explain why you are opposed to manufacturer, distributor and retailer liability for sale of assault rifles used in mass killings? Would you consider changing your position? If not, understanding that the NRA has given you a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/20/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-nra-report-card-d-minus-most-recent/\">D-minus</a> rating (something you brag about, we heard you), even so, are you in bed with the NRA in some way? Is this evidence of your corruption?&nbsp;</p><h4>One for the Repubs</h4><p>The professional operators are moving in on the Republican side, now that the race has been reduced to three, and some real slick fucks are showing up.&nbsp;</p><p>One of them yesterday referred to Hillary Clinton, repeatedly as \"Mrs Clinton.\"</p><p>That's not cool. Her correct title is <i>Secretary Clinton.</i></p><p>When you change her title to something so old-timey, that's an obvious dog-whistle for \"Women's place is in the home baking cookies.\"</p><p>Stop doing that.&nbsp;</p>",

If not, he's playing a dangerous game with our future, and doesn't, imho, deserve your support.</p><p>There's a lot of powerless talk now. People don't have any control over events. We all have our say. You have to convince us if you want to win. The first sign of a revolutionary is not that they pout, or feel self-pity -- that's not revolutionary. It's a relentlessness, that if you don't get it this year, you'll be back next year. And the year after that. Etc.</p><p>HRC was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=how+old+is+hillary+clinton\">60</a> when she lost to Obama in 2008. So what did she do? Sulk? Complain? Not vote for Obama? Stay silent when her pouting supporters complained? No, she picked herself up and got busy, and came back at age 68 to try again. She never claimed to be a revolutionary but that's a <i>lot</i> more revolutionary than being a victim.</p><p>There's a context to this year's vote that's inescapable. In 2012 if you abstained, the worst that would have happened is Mitt Romney, which would have been pretty bad considering that Congress was about to become fully Republican. But this year, abstaining could mean turning the US over to a crazy KKK-loving Nazi strongman. One that even the Repubs don't support. That's pretty damned awful if you stop and think about it!</p><p>No, we don't have to worry about this. The threat isn't credible. Come November Bernie's supporters will do the right thing.

You think it can't happen, well people always think that, until it happens. And most don't realize it was just a remix until long after it's been integrated into our way of doing things, and then it just seems normal, and boring, if not useful.</p><p>For example, today Facebook seems normal. Is it a remix? Yes of course. It's USENET groups, or a BBS, or a blog-with-comments, or a chatroom, all of it schmushed up into a sprawl of features and services. But there was something important about Facebook when it was new -- three things really.</p><p></p><ol><li><span>It scaled. It was fast no matter how many people used it.</span></li><li><span>Huge amounts of venture capital was available to fund growth before they knew what their business model would be.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Everyone could use it. This was a combination of improving computer-using skills among normal people, and devs learning how people learn so we could make it easier. The two met at Facebook.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p></p><p>True, not <i>everyone</i> could use it, but enough people so that people who couldn't felt left out, instead of the people using it being weird (as we were in the day of USENET, BBSes and blogs).</p><p>But now it's <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=define+old+hat&amp;oq=define+old+hat\">old hat</a>. Many people think this is it. Everything has to compete with Facebook and it's so pervasive and fast that it can't happen, therefore it's all over. This is the way it will be forever. No one actually says that, but other things they say imply it. It's behind their thinking, rarely said out loud. Of course it's wildly wrong.</p><p>Because while Facebook is basically sitting there, serving as a backbone for all of the company's adventures and as a barrier to entry for upstarts, other tech is roaring forward making previously unthinkable things more thinkable.</p><p>I have the ability to see into these technologies, and to see them as a user does. This gives me a pretty unique perspective. Network servers are now very cheap and getting easier to deploy. They have to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/03/24/1140.html\">get</a> just a little bit easier before enough people can start one up to create the kind of swell of people that Facebook created. And then what we will have will be just like everything else, but like nothing that came before, as Facebook was when it was new. And blogs, and BBSes and USENET all the way back to cave drawings.&nbsp;</p><p>What will we do with it? I have some opinions about that, and am developing my software accordingly. ;-)</p>",

Not that blogging changes so &nbsp;much, I don't think it does -- but the world around my blog is changing all the time. So the <i>context</i> in which blogging exists changes.</p><p>First, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/om\">Om Malik</a> published a <a href=\"http://om.co/2016/03/26/how-to-write-a-good-blog-post/\">piece</a> yesterday about how to write a good blog post. As I read it I was reminded of a brief Twitter conversation I had the day before with Hossein Derakhshan, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/h0d3r/status/713368344653651968\">started</a> by saying \"Social media have scattered our 'self'. Now they're doing that to #journalism. Era of unified, single website is over.\"&nbsp;</p><p>These two people who I only know because they blog, are right -- but then I thought -- no I don't agree. And yes, it's something I've been struggling with, but for me the struggle is over. I write my blog not because I want to write a \"good\" blog post, or even one that's read by a lot of people. And my own self is not scattered, it's right here, and as long as I live it will continue to be here. And my online self doesn't exist for the benefit of others, it's here to help my real self develop his thinking and create a trail of ideas and feelings and experiences that I can look back on later.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a body of online writing going back almost 22 years, I've benefitted from that, many times. For example, my memory told me that I was against the Iraq war right from the start. But that is contradicted by my blog. I had doubts, but I supported the President. I felt I had no choice. This has turned out to be an important consideration in this year's election. We'd all like to think we were against the war from the start, but the reality is most of us were not against it (which is different from being for it, Bernie). Recall the times and the fear we had about our own safety. Our President laid out a set of facts that turned out later to be lies. Yes, we were suspicious. But did we have a choice but to go with our leader? Most of us felt we had to support him.&nbsp;</p><p><span>I think Hossein is right, for the short term, and wrong for the long term. There are too many technological and societal things happening for the current situation to stay unchanged much longer. Kids who have grown up in the last ten years have never known a world where they couldn't set up their own server. That would be like me, as a young kid, having my own radio station, which I did, even though it was hard to do and illegal! Because I felt compelled to broadcast. I loved communication tech as a kid. It was visceral. There must be kids like that today. Why should they respect what Hossein thinks is the indelible future? No one asked them! Remember what it's like to be coming of age and finding out the whole world had been carved up so that you had to fit in a very tight little box. Some of us didn't like that, and some rebelled against it. Well you may feel it's all over and the structure of the world has already been decided, but I can promise you one thing -- they don't.&nbsp;</span></p><p>And I don't. I still get a thrill at putting up my own web service. I know it's right. And we haven't lost that ability yet. But it could happen. And that will just mean, imho, that it will take a bit longer for the next iteration to come about. And I promise you it won't have any respect for the rules of the previous iteration. That's just not how our species works.</p>",

Technically Medium is no worse than other systems, and lately has become better, because it now has an API, as Ev is mentioning right now in the video as I'm listening to it.</p><p>The reason I focus on Medium is because it is becoming the default platform for people writing blog posts. But Medium is actually part of the open web.</p><p>Joi is now asking the right question. It would be great if Medium directly supported Instant Articles as-is. Interop is great. Many ways to do the same thing sucks.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn't need to talk to Facebook to support IA. It's an open format.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with the way Medium API works is that you can't flow updates to it. So if I make a change later the update doesn't show up on Medium.</p><p>BTW, I heard a touch of irony in Ev's voice as he questioned whether Medium was really the 800-pound gorilla in this space. They aren't, Facebook is. But Medium is still drawing a lot of good stuff away from the open web, and believe it or not that's okay with me, &nbsp;as long as it can be <i>shared back</i> into rest of the web, exactly as Joi was discussing. That's what was so great about what Facebook did, they said the content shared with them through IA can be shared anywhere, as-is, without modification. I think this is actually smart, following through on the Central Park analogy -- if they feed back to the open web, there's at least a chance of new interesting stuff being created outside the silos. There's certainly no way anyone but a FB employee can directly add value to the FB platform and same with Medium. But the open web, by definition, is not in any way exclusive. Anyone can do whatever they like, without permission from Ev or Zuck.</p><h4>Links</h4><p>Anyway the big pieces relevant to this conversation are:</p><p></p><ol><li><a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/20/0900.html\">Anywhere But Medium</a>.</li><li><a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/24/1054.html\">How Instant Articles Supports the Open Web</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/27/0724.html\">The vision of Central Park</a>.</li></ol>",

It's true Facebook could have done something to make this not happen, but they didn't. And as discussed yesterday, to some extent we are all trying to co-exist in Facebook's publishing ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So my advice to Medium and/or IFTTT, please make sure you can handle an IA-capable feed. I'm leading-edge on this, I suspect this will become a big issue for you soon.&nbsp;</p><p>I would actually like to see Medium embrace RSS directly instead of depending in IFTTT to act as an intermediary. It's a pretty well-established standard by now. Why not embrace it and make life a little easier for the publishers?</p>",

Link is at the end of this post.</p><p></p><ol><li><span>I've created a new blogging system called 1999.io.</span></li><li><span>Anyone can run a server. The server software is open source, MIT License. In that way it's comparable to WordPress or Ghost and unlike Blogger, Medium and Tumblr. I want it to be easy and free to set up and run a server.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>It's written in JavaScript, running in Node.js.</span></li><li><span>Each blog can have multiple users, each server can have multiple blogs. Think of 1999 as a community of communities of communities.</span></li><li><span>The software is patterned after a product I created at UserLand Software called Manila. It shipped in 1999. Hence the tagline -- </span><i>Blogging like it's 1999.&nbsp;</i></li><li>It's the writing and publishing system I've been <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/03/29/1152.html\">using</a> for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">Scripting News</a>\n since October. It works! I love it more than any blogging system I've ever used. I'm not kidding.</li><li><span>It's got features that no blogging system has ever had, like a live connection between the story pages and the server, so updates flow back automatically to every reader. It does liveblogging automatically, without any plug-ins, iFrames, hacks, etc.</span></li><li>It's super easy to create a new post. Since that's the first thing you want to do, and I want you to do a lot of it, I made it very very easy. Here's a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYZKUVJfuMI\">video demo</a>.</li><li><span>Rather than open the system by offering free hosting, instead I am starting with server sysops. So I need help testing that. To be part of this group you should set up a server. It must be publicly accessible, and you need to set up a free app on Twitter. But it's totally doable, if you were able to set up River5 you should be able to set this up.</span></li><li><span>So if you're into helping me do this bootstrap, please sign up for the </span><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/1999-server\">mail list</a><span>. I'm not saying I'll approve everyone at first, I want to have a sense that you will be able to give decent bug reports as we shake out the initial setup issues. Please understand.</span></li></ol><p></p><p>This is exciting! Let's have fun! :-)</p><p><a href=\"http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav\"><img src=\"http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif\" width=\"53\" height=\"63\" border=\"0\" alt=\"I'm trying to think but nothing happens!\"></a>\n</p><p>Dave</p>",

Flatten out the differences between the OSes as much as possible. Why not. No one cares about that stuff, that's the layer that was established 30 years ago.

Of course, he's a professional politician. I know we're supposed to hate them, but the problem is we need them. And BF is one of the good ones. Smart guy.</p><p>First, if you want to know who to blame for why everything is so fucked (if you believe it is), if you're a voter and you only vote in Presidential election years, then look in the mirror. If we, who voted for Obama the last couple of times, also voted in the off-year elections, the House and Senate might be Democratic, and you would have gotten more what you want.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a college student with big loans, you might have gotten relief by now. Because the government serves people who vote. Remember that one.</p><p>If you elect President Sanders, you're going to have to vote every year, otherwise you'll be complaining about him too.</p><p>About <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders\">Sanders</a>, what did he get done in the 25 years he's been in Congress? Basically not very much because the guy didn't work with others. No compromise in him, I guess, or maybe he just isn't that social. But it's not going to get any better for him if he's President. We've elected Presidents before who thought Congress had to come to him, it doesn't work that way.&nbsp;</p><p>The most effective presidents are pretty much assholes you wouldn't want to have a beer with. Look at some <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=lyndon+johnson+in+your+face&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0r7ypruvLAhVrs4MKHQV-D1cQ_AUIBygB&amp;biw=1227&amp;bih=1198\">pictures</a> of Lyndon Johnson relating to other DC politicos. He used to talk to people while he was <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/lists/a-brief-history-of-presidential-profanity-20121210/lyndon-johnson-19691231\">taking</a> a shit, with the door open! And when he got in your face he <i>totally</i> got in your face. Not a great pal, but boy did he <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society\">get things done</a>.</p><p>Carter is a great example of a Sanders-like President. He was a saint. And really smart, and a good campaigner, and after Watergate and Ford's pardon of Nixon exactly the punishment we all wanted and voted for ourselves. Carter is a great man, but not because he was President, rather because he was a great <i>ex</i>-President.&nbsp;</p><p>Last night Rachel Maddow asked Sanders if he would use some of the money he was raising to support down-ticket candidates. He said no, over and over. I couldn't believe what he was saying. I don't think Maddow could believe it either. And he thinks he's going to get super-delegates to work with him to throw out HRC who is working on raising money for Congress and state offices. As a good top-of-ticket candidate must. It comes with the job. I don't think Bernie gets that.</p><p>Not only can't Sanders win with that approach, he clearly doesn't want to create a legacy even if he knows he can't win. Sanders could do a lot for his campaign finance goal right now, this minute, by helping elect people using his access to money. He can't effectively spend all he's raising. I don't understand what game he's playing. Certainly not trying to build some kind of revolution, that's baloney. A revolutionary would be seizing this moment, rather than complaining about the past.&nbsp;</p><p>You want to change the way campaigns are financed Bernie, then fucking do it and stop talking about it. Carpe diem man.&nbsp;</p><p>BTW, one of the reasons our most effective presidents are assholes is that the USA is an asshole country. You want to make it live up to the hype and be a bastion of freedom, where everyone gets a chance to win, and we don't do crazy shit to the world and ourselves? Well that's a big hill to climb. Maybe it's possible, I kind of doubt it is, but if it were to happen you'd have to do a lot more than elect one good President and expect somehow that's going to change hundreds of years of being an asshole country.&nbsp;</p>",
