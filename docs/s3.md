## Using Amazon S3 to store data

You can easily configure the server to store data on Amazon S3. You just have to set up config.json to indicate that you're not using the local filesystem and tell it where on S3 you want to store the public files and the private files.

Here's a <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/f37ec1650c29da0547766fd1093ee9fd">config.json</a> that's set up to work with S3 storage. 

Your account must have the ability to read and write from the locations you're using.

For the private files it's a good idea to use a bucket that is not accessible over the web, but nodeStorage will work with whatever space you give it, public or private.
